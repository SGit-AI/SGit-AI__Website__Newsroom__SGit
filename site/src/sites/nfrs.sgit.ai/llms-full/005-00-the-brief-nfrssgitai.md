## 1. The commission

> *"the home for lots of the NFR related topics we have covered in quite detail — for example CI pipelines, security, scalability, resilience, explainability, serverless, architecture, testing, documentation, budgets/finance, project management…"*

And the framing that matters more than the topic list:

> *"the idea of these sites is to provide good briefs for agents to learn about how we work and think — **these sites are a more evolved and focused version of what is usually called LLM memory**."*

That second sentence is the clearest statement of the whole `*.sgit.ai` network's purpose made anywhere in this project, and it should not stay buried in a chat message. `02__` develops it into a page — and recommends it also land on the `sgit.ai` hub, because it explains all fourteen sites at once.

---

## 2. The name — verdict: yes, `nfrs.sgit.ai`

Three reasons it is right:

1. **It is your own operative term, already defined in the corpus.** The villagers brief: *"what I call the non-functional requirements, which fundamentally is **the whole version control, reliability, resilience, security, backups, consistency, explainability, and documentation**."* That sentence is this site's table of contents, written a month before the site was conceived.
2. **It fits the network's naming pattern** — plural subject nouns: `risks.` `graphs.` `skills.` `twins.` `standards.` `nfrs.` reads as one of the family.
3. **The jargon objection does not apply here.** "NFR" is opaque to a general reader — but the stated audience is **agents and technical readers**, for whom it is precise and unambiguous. The alternatives are worse: `quality.` is vague, `engineering.` overclaims, `operations.` misses half the list.

Two conditions: **expand the acronym in the first sentence of the front page**, and note that the corpus itself writes it both ways ("non-functional requirements" in prose, NFR in speech) — the site should use *NFRs* as the name and the full phrase on first use per page.

## 3. The shape: this is a hub site

Unlike `twins.` (a primitive) or `sg-compute.` (a platform), this site is a **hub over topics that mostly already have owners** in the network. The measured densities and the split:

| Topic | Files | This site's role |
|---|---:|---|
| **Testing** | 279 | **OWNS** — no-mocks-no-patches, deploy-via-pytest, the structural-guard pattern, 4,785-tests-in-81s |
| **CI pipelines** | 273 | **OWNS** — digest-first multi-arch, AMI bake-and-verify, auto-increment versioning |
| **Documentation** | 651 | **OWNS** — the reality-document system, briefs-are-aspirations, the markdown twin, day-indexes |
| **IFD (the methodology)** | guides | **OWNS** — Iterative Flow Development, versioned guides written explicitly *"for LLMs"* |
| **Budgets / finance** | 410 | **OWNS the discipline** — pre-approve-the-ladder, profitability-first, budget-on-the-step |
| **Project management** | 31 | **OWNS** — the PM-is-where-the-register-becomes-work brief, the brief/debrief system itself |
| **Resilience** | 100 | **OWNS the patterns** — the watchdog, health poller, teardown paths (artefacts live in `sg-compute.`) |
| **Explainability** | 65 | **LINKS** — the grounding ladder is `risks.`/`standards.`; this site owns "computed, not claimed" as an engineering habit |
| **Serverless / scalability** | 347 / 104 | **LINKS** — `sg-compute.` owns the platform; this site owns the *requirement* framing |
| **Security** | — | **LINKS** — `pki.` `nhi.` `sg-sentinel.` own domains; this site owns the *NFR posture* (audit-before-the-key, key-leak CI gates) |
| **Architecture** | — | **LINKS** — `coding.` owns conventions; this site owns responsibility-boundaries as a requirement class |

**The rule: this site owns the disciplines that have no other home, and the topic map that shows an agent where everything else lives.** `01__` is that map.

## 4. The spine: the villagers sentence, from the inside

The network already tells the NFR story from the *market* side — `open-source.sgit.ai` owns *"somebody has to be the villagers"* as an economic argument. **This site is the same sentence from the inside: how *we* actually do the NFRs the villagers sell.**

That gives the site an unusual honesty obligation, because this session has already measured the estate against its own NFR list:

| NFR (his list) | The estate, measured |
|---|---|
| Version control | ✅ 2,777 commits/100 days, auto-increment tags, the `version` file convention |
| Reliability / resilience | ✅ watchdog, poller, bake-and-verify — **and** a dead workflow (`sg-play` ×16) nobody noticed |
| Security | ✅ key discipline, allowlists — **and** one disclosed key-in-history incident, handled well |
| Backups | ⚠️ **thinnest topic in the corpus** — 151 mentions, no doctrine |
| Consistency | 🟡 100% banner compliance beside 39% import alignment; four stale sources of truth |
| Explainability | ✅ reality docs, provenance — **and** no evals anywhere |
| Documentation | ✅ 1.27M words with a governing rule — **and** a README describing a repo that does not exist |

**Publish that table.** A site teaching NFRs from a corpus that visibly practises *and* visibly lapses is credible in a way no clean-room guide can be — and every lapse is already documented in a sibling pack with the evidence.

## 5. The numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| **Densities** | documentation 651 · budget 410 · observability 393 · serverless 347 · unit test 279 · CI 273 · backup 151 · scalability 104 · resilience 100 · reliability 74 · explainability 65 · PM 31 · "non-functional" 26 |
| **The definition** | one sentence in the villagers brief, listing **eight NFRs verbatim** |
| **Owned disciplines** | testing · CI · documentation/reality · IFD · budgets · PM · resilience patterns |
| **The methodology** | IFD — versioned guides (`v1.2.1`), written *"for LLMs assisting with IFD-based development"* |
| **This pack** | 7 documents · manifest of 26 rows · every path verified |

## 6. Build order

1. **`/map/`** — the topic map (`01__`). The hub's reason to exist: one page an agent reads to know where everything lives.
2. **`/memory/`** — the sites-as-agent-memory thesis (`02__`). The page that explains the network.
3. **`/testing/` and `/ci/`** — the two strongest owned disciplines, with the measured numbers.
4. **`/documentation/`** — the reality-document system: *"if the reality document doesn't list it, it does not exist… briefs are aspirations, not facts."*
5. **`/budgets/` and `/pm/`** — pre-approve-the-ladder, profitability-first, the brief/debrief system.
6. **`/scorecard/`** — §4's table, unsoftened, linked to the sibling packs' evidence.
7. **`/shipped/`** — what this site asserts vs what the estate demonstrably does.
