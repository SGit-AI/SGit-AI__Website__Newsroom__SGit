# 01 — The topic map

The hub's core artefact: one page an agent reads to know **what each NFR means here, where the canonical material lives, and what the estate actually does about it.** Each entry: the position in one line, the best source, the owner site.

---

## Testing — OWNED

**Position:** *"No mocks. No patches."* Assert on contracts, not implementation; real Chromium gated on an env var, skipping cleanly; deploy **via pytest**, numbered tests run top-down. Affordable because `Type_Safe` objects are cheap to compose in memory — the type system and the testing philosophy are one decision.

**Evidence:** 4,785 tests passing in 81 seconds; 799 test files; the four `tests/ci/` structural guards (one broken — the honest footnote). **Canonical:** `library/guides/v3.1.1__testing_guidance.md` + the sg-compute measurements. **Cross-link:** `coding.sgit.ai` owns the conventions; this site owns the philosophy and the numbers.

## CI pipelines — OWNED

**Position:** the pipeline is a *verifier*, not a runner: native per-arch builds, **push by digest only**, integration-test the pre-tag image, only then assemble the manifest; AMIs are baked, **relaunched, and re-verified** before tagging `healthy`; versions auto-increment from one repo-root file.

**Evidence:** the 36,815-byte `ci-pipeline.yml`, the two-phase `bake-ami.yml` — and the lapse: that workflow invokes a binary (`sg-play`) defined nowhere, sixteen times. **Owner of the artefacts:** `sg-compute.sgit.ai`; this site owns the *pattern* write-up.

## Documentation — OWNED

**Position:** documentation is a **truth system, not prose**. The reality-document rule: *"**If the reality document doesn't list it, it does not exist.** Briefs are aspirations, not facts."* Proposed features labelled `PROPOSED`. Every page has a markdown twin. Day-indexes, debriefs with good-failure/bad-failure classification, CC BY footer on ~1,100+ files.

**Evidence:** 1.27M words in one repo alone; 72,339 words of reality docs across 12 domains — and the lapse: the reality index itself 41 versions stale, and a README describing a repo that does not exist. **The page writes itself: the system, the rule, and the two places it failed.**

## IFD — Iterative Flow Development — OWNED

**Position:** the estate's named methodology — *"rapid software development using AI assistance while maintaining engineering rigor… centred on **preserving developer flow state**."* Versioned guides (intro, testing, versioning) at `v1.2.x`, written explicitly *"for LLMs assisting with IFD-based development."* Minor versions are the Explorer team's output unit; majors are Villager releases.

**Canonical:** `library/guides/development/ifd/`. **Nobody outside the estate has ever seen this methodology written up.** It is this site's most original owned asset.

## Budgets and finance — OWNED (the discipline, not the business)

**Position:** three pillars. **Profitability-first:** *"until we know the traction… financial projections and future predictions are made-up, because we do not yet have the data."* **Pre-approve the ladder:** approve the overrun positions at approval time — 1.5×, 2×, 5× — *"with the stopping point named while it is still cheap to name"*, because the research says *"the person who approved the first million is, on the evidence, the worst available decider on the second."* Plus the novel acceptance: *"the things **not** done because this project was funded should themselves be accepted, with an owner."* **Budget-on-the-step:** budgets attached to workflow steps, not projects.

**Boundary:** the *discipline* is publishable; the estate's own figures are Tier-3 everywhere. **Cross-link:** token-spend-as-engineering-problem is `wardley-maps.`'s line.

## Project management — OWNED

**Position:** *"the project manager is where the register becomes work"* — a register per project, net score, erosion, the missing reference class. Plus the estate's own PM system as the exhibit: briefs with acceptance criteria, cross-team reviews, day-indexes, numbered asks (N1…) and tasks (T1…), version-prefixed filenames, session handover guides. **The brief/debrief system is itself the estate's PM methodology, demonstrated across ~4,000 documents.**

## Resilience — OWNED (patterns); artefacts live in `sg-compute.`

**Position:** design for the failure you had, not the one you imagine. The watchdog (`os._exit(2)` through a deadlock, GIL reasoning in the source), the two-phase health poller, halt-means-terminate, idle reconciliation, build-time guards each citing a production incident. **Every resilience mechanism in the estate traces to a named incident** — that is the doctrine, and it is nowhere written down.

## Security — LINKS

The NFR posture only: audit-before-the-key · deny-by-default allowlists · key-prefix validation · no-credentials-in-git with CI gates · the disclosed-incident norm. Domains belong to `pki.` `nhi.` `sg-sentinel.` `standards.`; the LLM boundary to `llms.`.

## Serverless and scalability — LINKS

The requirement framing only — *"no servers running when there is no traffic, with a defined cost to start"* — and the honesty note that throughput is argued, never measured. Platform: `sg-compute.`.

## Explainability — LINKS

The engineering habit only: **computed, not claimed** · unanswered-is-an-output · estimates rendered with `~`. The grounding ladder belongs to `risks.`/`standards.`; provenance to `llms.`.

## Architecture — LINKS

Responsibility boundaries as a requirement class (*"X is the ONLY class that…"*), single-source-of-truth by structure. Conventions: `coding.`.

## Backups — ⚠️ THE GAP

151 mentions, **no doctrine.** The one estate with irreversible publishing (frozen vaults), a keys-vault design, and no written backup/recovery discipline beyond the keys-vault `RECOVERY.md` proposal. **The site should say so — it is the eighth item on the corpus's own NFR list and the only one with no material.**
