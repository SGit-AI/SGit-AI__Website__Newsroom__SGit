# 02 — The memory thesis: these sites are agent memory, done better

The commissioning message contains the clearest statement of the network's purpose ever made:

> *"the idea of these sites is to provide good briefs for agents to learn about how we work and think — **these sites are a more evolved and focused version of what is usually called LLM memory**."*

This document develops that into the page it deserves — and recommends it also appear on `sgit.ai`, because it explains all fourteen sites at once.

## 1. The claim

What products call "memory" today is an accumulation: embeddings of past conversations, retrieved by similarity, private to one vendor's silo, unversioned, uncurated, and invisible to the person it describes.

The `*.sgit.ai` network is the same function built as **publishing**:

| | Conventional LLM memory | These sites |
|---|---|---|
| **Content** | accumulated transcripts | **curated briefs** — written, reviewed, pruned |
| **Retrieval** | similarity search, opaque | **addressable URLs** + `llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt` |
| **Versioning** | none | git, version-prefixed filenames, dated pages |
| **Truthfulness** | whatever was said | the reality-document rule: *"briefs are aspirations, not facts"* |
| **Portability** | locked to one vendor | **any agent, any vendor, one HTTP GET** |
| **Licence** | unclear | **CC BY 4.0, explicit, irrevocable** |
| **Inspectable by the human** | rarely | it is a website — read your own memory |
| **Shared across agents** | no | yes — one memory, N agents, no sync |

The one-line version for the front page: **memory you can read, cite, version, license and hand to any agent — because it is a website.**

## 2. The evidence that this was already the design

The estate has been building toward this explicitly, before the sentence was said:

- Guides with **`for_llms` in the filename** — `v3.1.1__for_llms__type_safe__testing_guidance.md`, `v3.63.4__for_llms__python_formatting_guide.md` — and the IFD guide's purpose line: *"Complete reference **for LLMs** assisting with IFD-based development."*
- **The markdown twin at every URL**, *"so a traversing agent never has to parse HTML."*
- **The agent-access report's finding** — *"the audience is disproportionately agents… it can read the map and cannot walk it"* — which is a memory-retrieval failure diagnosed in exactly those terms.
- The house pattern itself: `/llms.txt` as the whole agent surface, single-file concatenation, numbered asks an agent can act on.

## 3. What "more evolved" concretely means — the disciplines this site teaches

The memory thesis is an NFR story, which is why this page lives here: a memory is only better than a transcript if somebody maintains its non-functional requirements.

1. **Curation is the villagers' work applied to knowledge.** Someone owns each site, prunes it, and keeps it true — the reality-doc discipline as memory hygiene.
2. **Versioning makes memory correctable** — the thing a frozen vault and a transcript both cannot do.
3. **The do-not-publish tiers are memory's security model.** Every pack in this series ships one; a memory without redaction discipline leaks.
4. **`shipped/` pages are memory's calibration.** A memory that cannot distinguish designed from built teaches agents to overclaim — the single most common failure this session found across the estate's stale artefacts.
5. **Deconfliction is memory's normalisation.** One canonical copy, siblings link — the skills pack's diverging duplicate is what happens otherwise.

## 4. The honest limits

- **Staleness is the failure mode**, and the estate has already demonstrated it four times (capabilities.json, the reality index, the README, `sg_compute/version`). A memory-site network needs the generate-or-date rule everywhere.
- **Curated memory is opinionated memory.** These sites teach *how we think* — an agent trained on them inherits the positions, including the wrong ones. The tensions-published-unresolved convention is the mitigation, and it is a real one.
- **Fourteen sites is itself a retrieval problem.** Without the topic map (`01__`) and cross-site deconflicts, the network reproduces the discovery failure the agent-access report found in one site.
