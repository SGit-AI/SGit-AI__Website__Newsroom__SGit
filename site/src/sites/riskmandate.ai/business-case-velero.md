# RiskMandate — the business case for Velero

Velero (CNCF (sandbox)), by the risk it changes: the register for a stated agent deployment without it and with it, computed from a public model, from the operator to the board.

# Velero, by the risk it changes

Backup and restore for Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes. Written as an answer, what an agent changes in a cluster can be partly undone, as of the last backup.

**Open source:** Apache-2.0 · CNCF (sandbox) · [get involved](https://velero.io/community/)

**The deployment:** The model's typical deployment, with the answers this project addresses stated as they are without it: some of what it changes cannot be undone.

**The model:** the RiskGraph Explorer's 49 facts, 49 risks and 10 roles, copied into this site with its provenance; the register below is computed, not written. [How](business-cases.html#method).

## In its own words, and nothing more.

- Backups of cluster resources and volumes, and restores. “If the resource already exists in the target cluster” · [velero.io](https://velero.io/docs/v1.18/restore-reference/), read 24 September 2026

## Same deployment, different answers.

The model asks sixteen questions about an agent deployment. A product’s effect is written as the answers it changes, and each change says what kind of change it is: a statement of what is true, an expectation the agent is asked to meet, a setting, or a boundary enforced by something the agent’s grant does not include.

## 4 retired, 1 new, 22 unchanged.

Computed from the model for the deployment above: every risk that holds without it, and every risk that holds with it. A new entry is either one the change brought to light, where an answer replaced a don’t know, or a narrower risk in place of a wider one, where the answer moved from no to partly. Either way the register is more exact, and a register that grows because something was found is working.

Retired

New

## Who carries less, and who carries the same.

Each risk is assigned to the roles it belongs to, and each role reports to another until the board. The count beside each role is the entries it holds without the product and with it.

### Operators

### Owners

### Executives

### The board

At the board: the corporate register

Corporate risks have no facts of their own. They hold while any risk that leads into them holds, so a single product rarely retires one. What it changes is how many reasons the board is being given.

## Every product is also a new thing in the estate.

A backup is a second copy of the data, and the credential that takes it can read everything in scope. Anything changed since the last backup is still lost.

## What adopting it takes, before any of this is true.

An open-source project costs nothing to download and something to adopt. Every change above depends on the work below, and most of it is customisation to your own deployment.

- Schedule backups often enough for the agent's rate of change.
- Set the existing-resource policy, so an edit can be reverted and not only a deletion.
- Practise a restore.

## The limits of the case, stated by the case.

- That it was tested. Nothing was installed or run; every change rests on the documentation quoted beside it.
- That the register is complete. It is one model, for one stated deployment. A different deployment changes the answers, and so the case.

**Next.** Published, and sent to the project's maintainers at the same time. If a change is wrong, or another answer should move, the case changes with the date they said so.

## Make the case in the register’s own terms.

If you build a security product for agents, the case for it can be written the same way: what it does in your own words, the answers it changes, and the register before and after. If a case here is wrong about you, tell us and it changes with a date.
