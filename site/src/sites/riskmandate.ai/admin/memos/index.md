# The memo queue

> Every document, memo and instruction riskmandate.ai was built from, in the order it arrived, with what it produced and what it still owes — read off briefs-register.json.
> Source: https://riskmandate.ai/admin/memos/ · noindex · written by scripts/site/build-admin.mjs

**2**received, nothing built yet*Archived and read, and nothing has been built from it yet.*

**25**partly worked*read in full; a named part is not built*

**8**processed*something on the site exists because of it*

**0**superseded*kept because the reasoning is the record*

The queue. A document or a memo from the project lead arrives — a dev brief as a file, a voice memo as a transcript, an instruction in the thread — and is archived exactly as received: files by SHA-256 in [the register](../../briefs-register.json), so an identical file arriving again is recognised before anybody reads it; speech and chat as an entry with no digest. Then it is read into [a brief](../../admin/briefs/), and the brief is broken into [units of work](../../admin/work/). What was said and what we made of it are kept apart on purpose.

**[Voice memo: the next phase is users. The MVP is nailed and the vaults are more than most first users need, so find many smaller examples where a policy adds value now. The abp.sgit.ai/gmail prompt workflow - four steps, thirteen prompts, about twenty minutes - is the shareable artefact, already sent to a real group. KPIs and OKRs are the number of users who run the prompts and the number who create a policy; the pricing ladder exists, what is missing is a bigger free funnel above it. Nobody buys a full policy until they have made a smaller one. And the second frontier, beyond technical permissions: consequences in the user's own terms (relabelling destroys a mailbox's information architecture, marking read things unread, too many sends, drafts or moves), which messages should and should not be read or replied to, prompt injection, and rules of engagement for a single session.](#I11)**

Use this vault as the case study and change whatever we want on it. Find good ways to visualise it, because that is where the gaps are and the question is whether people are aware. The vendor's own restriction is a control we can reverse engineer and make the business case for. On the vault: three audience folders (executive, operator, risk) as the main section of the left menu, the executive view being the whole thing in one line, a couple of diagrams and a couple of paragraphs; keep the packs and the how-to-use, but not centre stage.](#I10)**

## The four steps

- **1 · Capture**

The file goes into `site/assets/briefs/` byte for byte and its digest into `briefs-register.json` the moment it arrives. Speech is transcribed and archived the same way; nothing is trimmed.

- **2 · Read**

A brief under `docs/briefs/`: what was asked, what it changes, what it contradicts, and what is not yet decidable. One page each, [here](../../admin/briefs/).

- **3 · Break**

Task briefs under `.claude/briefs/`, each sized for one agent and naming the files it touches, and a row in the queue.

- **4 · Track**

The row moves on [the board](../../admin/work/); the register's *status* and *not done* say what the memo still owes.

## What happened to each of them

## An article on the risk propagation visualiser: user stories first, then the story, business analysis, and the technical analysis last, with captures of the figure at every step, each connection alone and combined, each control alone and all of them

[the file as received](../../assets/briefs/2026-09-25__transcript__an-article-on-the-risk-propagation-visualiser.txt) · `f3849c17c9fb…` · 1 KB

**Produced.** [The article, in the order asked: seven user stories; the six weeks as a story; how to read the six bands, the two colours and a click; each connection alone (CRM, Mail, Calendar), then combined, where the trifecta appears; eight controls one at a time and then all of them, with a table of what each ends and leaves; the business analysis and five questions for a room; the technical analysis down to the one-way walk. Thirty-four captures, each taken by script in the state its caption names](../../article-risk-propagation-visualiser.html)

**Not done.**

- Captures of a real agent. Every picture is of the invented example; running the figure on a published ABP vault is the next step the article names.
- A capture per role for all thirteen of the map's roles: the article shows the ones the argument needs (the rep, Sales, Legal, the CIO, the CEO, the board), not each one.

**Produced.** [How it works, rebuilt in the order the memo gives: six steps with the status of each on the step](../../how-it-works.html)

**Not done.**

- Connectors to a customer's own control planes (identity provider, cloud IAM, proxy, CI). Described as built per engagement and productised as they mature; none exists as a product and the page says so.
- The graph's edges upward to risks and the board, and sideways to a customer's internal policies and documents. Standards edges run today; these are marked in design.
- Execution logs and evidence held in the vault beside the policy, as the memo's provenance store. Marked as where this goes, not as something that exists.

**Not done.**

- Applying to anything. Every row says not started except Web Summit; which doors to try, starting with the Sovereign AI procurement challenge, is the lead's decision.
- A matching page on sgit.ai's partnerships section. That site is not in this repository; it can link here.
- Pages that refused an automated read (British Business Bank, london.gov.uk, blackhat.com, rsaconference.com, the Turing, the ABI) are marked unclear rather than filled from search results.

## Pilots do not stay in production: the business sees the gap between mandate and reach, at machine speed, and declines to sign for it

partly

[the file as received](../../assets/briefs/2026-09-24__transcript__pilots-do-not-stay-in-production.txt) · `762fd1ea85c2…` · 7 KB

**Produced.** [The pilot worked. Then somebody asked what else it could do: fourteen surveys and forecasts with the causes each names, seven cases, five variables the lethal trifecta leaves out, and what the data does not show](../../article-pilots-do-not-stay-in-production.html)

**Not done.**

- Data that tests the hypothesis. No survey found asks whether the gap between reach and mandate stopped sign-off; the article says so and asks readers for cases.
- The credit approval at two in the morning has no public source. It is told as an anecdote the author was told, and nothing more.
- The operating limit, headroom and hard maximum the memo recalls from an insurance vault were not found in the published demo vaults; the article presents the shape with invented numbers, labelled as such.

## Calendar edits cannot be undone: integrity risk, and why the edit permission is the dangerous one

partly

**Not done.**

- The Calendar behaviour policies themselves. They are in draft; the article quotes their rows and says so.
- A restore for edited events. Google documents none for users; Workspace with Vault keeps earlier versions an admin can export, and the article says the memo's claim holds for personal accounts and needs that qualification for Workspace.
- The early-user conversation (calendar over email) is reported as a handful of conversations, not a survey.

**Not done.**

- The two named cases (agentgateway; Auth0 for AI Agents) are built as drafts, unlisted and marked noindex, until the lead decides to send them to the vendors.
- A semantic graph per product beyond the model's sixteen questions. A case is written as the answers a product changes; products that act on things the questions do not ask about cannot yet be expressed.
- Outreach to the vendors. It is the lead's, after review.

## OWASP and open source first: a semantic graph of OWASP, business cases for the open-source projects that reduce risk, and the companies built on open source

**Produced.** [OWASP, as a graph: the foundation, four families, 52 projects and documents, 110 items of eleven lists by title, and the relationships OWASP states, joined to the risk model through the Agentic Top 10](../../owasp-graph.html) · [Eighteen open-source business cases, OWASP first, each change backed by the project's own words and each with what adopting it takes](../../business-cases.html#cases) · [Eighteen companies built on or beside an open-source project, with only the quotes that were checked word for word](../../business-cases.html#built-on-open-source)

**Not done.**

- Business cases for OWASP documents such as the Top 10s, ASVS and SAMM. They change what a team knows, not what an agent can reach, so they sit in the graph rather than as cases; the bridge shows which cases change the answers each Agentic Top 10 item depends on.
- Three Agentic Top 10 items touch nothing in the model: supply chain, memory and context, and agents talking to agents. The model has to grow for those.
- Outreach to OWASP projects, maintainers and the companies. The lead's, after review.

**Not done.**

- The keys vault itself. The first session creates it and gives its key to the lead, so the steps are exercised once with the lead watching.
- A way for a person to send corrections from inside their vault. Today they reply to the lead; a form is a question for the app vault.
- Any person's vault. The pack has been run end to end on a fictional organisation only.

**Produced.** [Three figures drawn by the page's own script from the article's data: the blast radius, which plays the six weeks or takes the reader's own changes (connect, disconnect, boundaries, instructions) and recomputes the rows, the risks, their holders and the counts; the six weeks as a strip; and the ontology, every verb readable from both ends](../../article-who-owns-what-in-ai.html) · [The instruction switch: the mandate becomes precise about the business process, every row in the gap gains an expectation, and unbounded excess does not move. The mail scope fact is cited from the Gmail record: three consent lines, each for the whole account](../../article-who-owns-what-in-ai.html)

**Not done.**

- Blast radius as a number. The figure shows which roles a risk reaches and who holds it; it does not size the consequence, because the article scores nothing.
- Real grants. The figure runs on the article's invented agent; wiring it to a published ABP vault, so a real grant drives the same picture, is the next step.
- The flows of evidence downward. A ceased risk cites its ABP version in text; the figure does not yet animate the evidence travelling back to the version.

**Not done.**

- A quantity of impact or potential loss on a risk. The figure gives each risk a consequence in words and an undo property, and no number: the article's own rule is that kinds of consequence do the work of a score, and a loss figure is the lead's decision.
- Other scenarios. The figure runs one agent; the lead said to keep it so for now.

**Produced.** [The colour travels up: while anything below a role is unaccepted, that role's path, halo and count are red.

**Not done.**

- The effectiveness of a control. The figure takes every control as working, as the lead said to for now; a control that is on and not working is a fact the ABP's evidence tiers exist to record, and it is not modelled here.
- Residual risks are drawn from a fixed list. In a real record they would be written by each holder in their own words when the control lands.

- A second, named reviewer: nothing about them is published until they have read their own page and agreed to it. The placeholder stands in the meantime.
- The chooser at checkout, which is the store's workflow rather than ours. The manifest is published for it; the arrangement is written up for the store team and nothing is agreed yet.
- Comments and testimonials. Asked for; none exist, and none will be composed here.
- Availability, a queue or a throughput number: none can be honoured yet, so the pages carry a status and the date it was confirmed instead.
- What the reviewer is paid — agreed in the brief and deliberately not published. A commercial term, and the lead's call.

I11 · voice memo, transcribed in the thread, with a screenshot of the Agentics Foundation London group, 21 Sept · 21 September 2026

## Voice memo: the next phase is users. The MVP is nailed and the vaults are more than most first users need, so find many smaller examples where a policy adds value now. The abp.sgit.ai/gmail prompt workflow - four steps, thirteen prompts, about twenty minutes - is the shareable artefact, already sent to a real group. KPIs and OKRs are the number of users who run the prompts and the number who create a policy; the pricing ladder exists, what is missing is a bigger free funnel above it. Nobody buys a full policy until they have made a smaller one. And the second frontier, beyond technical permissions: consequences in the user's own terms (relabelling destroys a mailbox's information architecture, marking read things unread, too many sends, drafts or moves), which messages should and should not be read or replied to, prompt injection, and rules of engagement for a single session.

I10 · voice memo, transcribed in the thread, 16 Sept · 16 September 2026

## Voice memo: the multi-layer grant, and the vault opens on the audience. Map three storeys — what the Google OAuth permission allows, what Anthropic's connector exposes to the chat (code, which can have bugs and can change at any minute's notice), and what normal usage and Claude's own guardrails allow — then the layer above, which is what becomes possible with those mechanical capabilities. Use this vault as the case study and change whatever we want on it. Find good ways to visualise it, because that is where the gaps are and the question is whether people are aware. The vendor's own restriction is a control we can reverse engineer and make the business case for. On the vault: three audience folders (executive, operator, risk) as the main section of the left menu, the executive view being the whole thing in one line, a couple of diagrams and a couple of paragraphs; keep the packs and the how-to-use, but not centre stage.

## Voice memo: the material to add to the Gmail-connector vault. Go back to first principles on the grant and map its side effects: a grant is the union of capabilities, and the reader needs the consequences, each explicit and each tied to the asset that makes it real (secrets in mail, reset links, mail from others); count the routes out; the authorisation to read is not the authorisation to forward; harvesting, mass send and what makes a platform suspend an account; mass change to the inbox's filing; realistic scenarios on the mandate; standards as mini-graphs in the vault; the vault navigated as a website with materials per audience.

- The four offerings are not yet listed on the site as offerings. The store publishes four tiers and two add-ons; pricing.html still describes the free/paid line rather than the ladder.

All six load-bearing quotations were fetched and checked against their sources rather than relayed, which produced two corrections to the brief that are stated on the page: the partially-verified state additionally requires the author to have enabled vigilant mode, and the claim that the attribution renders a profile picture and link could not be found on the page cited.

- The provider comparison table, which the brief says writes itself from the sources: network on by default locally and hosted, allow list present, all egress paths or one, survives being written into a repository, fails open or closed, resolution covered, and a log the operator can read.
- The reconciliation tool between an agent's several destination lists — open question 3, and possibly the smallest useful thing we could ship on this capability.
- The generic pasteable document as an artefact. Lab 06 drafts it in a table; open question 4 is whether it should be published before the custom generator exists.

**Notes.** Seven load-bearing quotations were fetched and checked rather than relayed, including the reference container's firewall script. Two departures from the brief are stated on the page: the brief reports observing the two egress paths diverge in one session, and in ours they did not — both reached every host tried — so the finding rests on the vendor's own sentences rather than on that observation; and we published our own measurement of this machine's egress instead, which found a raw outbound socket to an arbitrary public address and working name resolution with no allow list in either path.
