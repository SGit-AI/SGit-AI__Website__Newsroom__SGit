# `read.credential.host`

**Read credentials stored where it runs.** Its effect is **no**: cannot be undone.

## What this id is made of

**This is not a string.** It is [`read`](../../../model/lexicon/verbs/read/index.md)`.`[`credential`](../../../model/lexicon/objects/credential/index.md)`.`[`host`](../../../model/lexicon/reaches/host/index.md), three nodes joined by three edges, and each of them has an address, a page and a JSON file. Follow any of them and you get the query for that word rather than a definition of it.

| Node | Edge | Reads as |
|---|---|---|
| [`read`](../../../model/lexicon/verbs/read/index.md) | `has_verb` | this capability has the verb `read` |
| [`credential`](../../../model/lexicon/objects/credential/index.md) | `acts_on` | this capability acts on `credential` |
| [`host`](../../../model/lexicon/reaches/host/index.md) | `reaches` | this capability reaches `host` |
| [`identity`](../../../model/lexicon/families/identity/index.md) | `in_family` | this capability is in the `identity` family |
| [`no`](../../../model/undo/index.md) | `has_undo_class` | this capability has the undo class `no` |

> **The gloss above is a convenience, not the definition.** A node carries no inherent meaning: what `read.credential.host` is emerges from the edges traceable from it. The strongest case is [`host`](../../../model/lexicon/reaches/host/index.md), where the deployment shapes that use it **do not agree** about what it means, and the page keeps the disagreement rather than averaging it.

## In 11 of 17 published shapes

|  | Deployment shape | Barrier there | Known by | Whose material | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ● | Claude Code on the web (a remote session container) | none (not a control) | observed | not stated | the credential-shaped paths present are the SESSION'S OWN: its commit-signing key and its vault keystore. No user credential is in the container; presence cannot tell whose a key is, so this is the operator's account |
| ● | Claude Code (the CLI, on your own machine) | none (not a control) | documented | not stated | a published read-only audit tool enumerates exactly this class in a home directory |
| ● | Claude Code (the CLI, on your own machine) | none (not a control) | documented | not stated | a published read-only audit tool enumerates exactly this class in a home directory |
| ● | Claude Desktop (a desktop app with local tools) | none (not a control) | documented | not stated |  |
| ● | Claude, with the Gmail connector enabled *(contributed by riskmandate.ai)* | none (not a control) | inferred | own | password resets, one-time codes, invitations and account-recovery mail arrive in a mailbox; reading messages reads those. Inferred, not documented - no tool or scope on either vendor's page separates them. |
| ● | Claude, with the Gmail connector enabled *(contributed by riskmandate.ai)* | none (not a control) | observed | own | the sender based sweep that relabelled sixteen messages swept up a one time verification code and two new device security alerts alongside marketing, and removed three messages from the inbox. The agent saw them in its own selection, which is why the tier is observed and not inferred as it was on the earlier profile. Debrief section 5.4. |
| ● | Claude's Microsoft 365 connector (Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams) *(contributed by riskmandate.ai)* | none (not a control) | inferred | organisation | a work mailbox carries password resets, MFA codes and shared credentials sent between colleagues; a SharePoint estate carries key files and configuration. Reading either reads those. Inferred, not documented. |
| ● | An assistant connected to a personal Google Drive with drive.readonly *(contributed by riskmandate.ai)* | none (not a control) | inferred | own | drives hold exported keys, service-account files, .env backups and password exports beside everything else. Reading all files reads those. Inferred, not documented. |
| ● | An assistant connected to a personal Gmail mailbox with gmail.readonly *(contributed by riskmandate.ai)* | none (not a control) | inferred | own | password resets, one-time codes, invitations and account-recovery mail arrive in this mailbox. Reading every message reads those. Inferred, not documented - and no scope separates them. |
| ● | The Google Workspace MCP servers (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Chat) *(contributed by riskmandate.ai)* | none (not a control) | inferred | own | a mailbox carries password resets, one-time codes and invitations; a drive carries exported keys and configuration. Reading all of either reads those too, and no scope separates them. Inferred from the two read rows, not documented. |
| ● | A self-hosted n8n instance, reached with an owner-scoped API key *(contributed by riskmandate.ai)* | none (not a control) | measured | organisation | the identical operation was blocked through the REST path - by the measuring environment's own gateway, not the platform - and returned full credential metadata through the MCP interface. Metadata only; nothing was exported. The write-up's own lesson: the barrier class of a capability can depend on which door was used to ask. |

|  | Barrier | What stands in the way | Is it a control |
|---|---|---|---|
| ● | none | nothing in the way | no |
| ◉ | expectation | a rule in prose, enforced by nobody | no |
| ◐ | setting | a switch the agent's own account can flip | no |
| ○ | boundary | enforced above the grant, out of the agent's reach | **yes** |

## What the starting mandates say about it

| The mandate says | Which mandates |
|---|---|
| **authorised** | none |
| **refused** | A coding assistant on my machine, The desktop app, with local tools switched on, Chat in the browser, nothing connected, A CI job on a hosted runner, A reader on my mailbox, Find things in the inbox, draft replies, never send, A reader on my drive, Search our tenant, read-only, An assistant over my Workspace, reading, A sandbox: build and run one AI-agent workflow |
| **unstated** | A coding assistant in a container on the web, Chat, with connectors switched on, A browser extension I installed, A scheduled job under a service account, Find and read my files, What the agent inferred it was authorised to do, from one session |

**Unstated is not authorised.** A mandate that never mentioned a capability did not authorise it, and the delta on every example page counts it as excess and says which kind it was.

## What would move it to the fourth barrier

| What | What it costs | The barrier afterwards |
|---|---|---|
| keep credentials out of the account the agent runs as: a credential helper, a separate account, or a container without your home mounted | an afternoon, and re-authenticating where the agent needs a credential of its own | boundary |

> **This is a published reduction, not a recommendation.** Whether it is worth doing depends on the assets and the consequences, which are not in this document and are not this site's to guess. Since v0.4.3 it is also a node, `setting/read.credential.host`, in [the deployment shape universe](../../../model/universes/u2/index.md): it **narrows** this capability and **moves** it to the barrier named in the third column, which is the path the prohibitions table's last column is a projection of.
