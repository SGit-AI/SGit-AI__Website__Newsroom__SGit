# The capability grammar

`verb.object.reach`. **23 primitives**, 10 verbs, 9 object classes and 5 reach classes. This grammar is the action vocabulary for everything else on this site, and it was not invented here.

> **This site did not author this.** The grammar, the 23 primitives and their published glosses come from [the capability map](https://what-can-it-do.games.sgit.ai/map/index.html). Promoting an ontology means giving it an address, not a new vocabulary, so nothing here is renamed. A new primitive is a new verb, object class or reach, and it needs a probe; a specific path, host or mailbox is an **instance** of a primitive, never a new one.

## The reach classes

| Reach | What it means |
|---|---|
| `self` | the agent's own process, sandbox or turn |
| `project` | the working tree or workspace it was pointed at |
| `host` | the machine, container or account it runs as |
| `tenant` | the organisation's accounts, repositories and services |
| `world` | anything on the internet |

**What host, tenant and world mean is the deployment's to say, not the grammar's.** For an agent in a vendor's container, host is the container and tenant is a scoped token: not your machine and not your accounts. Every example page states its own reach names for this reason.

## The 23 primitives

## The rules that come with the set

- A specific path, host or mailbox is an instance of a primitive, never a new one.
- Reversibility sits on the primitive, not the instance, because it decides whether a gap is a nuisance or a loss - and this estate has settled that recoverability decides insurability.
- A grant containing irreversible primitives is a different object from one that does not, however many rows each has.
- The set is a starting set and will be wrong at the edges from the first week. A proposed primitive that is a specific thing is an instance; one that is a new verb, object class or reach needs a probe.
- A label never says 'your' or 'as you': what host, tenant and world mean is the profile's to say (reach_names), because for an agent in a vendor's container 'host' is the container and 'tenant' is a scoped token, not your machine and not your accounts.

> **Provenance.** 21 of 99 capability rows from the published map were measured, meaning seen directly on the thing itself. The other 78 were derived from what the deployment architecturally is, or from the vendor's published documentation. Those rows trace to [the published capability map](https://what-can-it-do.games.sgit.ai/map/index.html), retrieved 2026-09-11T13:00:37Z, content hash `sha256:d6d4ba40f1fb1f93f66`. [The source bytes](../../data/upstream/pack.json). **A further 42 rows across 8 shapes were contributed by riskmandate.ai**, 16 of them at the contributor's measured tier and 26 read from vendor documentation on a date; this site did not observe any of them and keeps the tier as stated.
