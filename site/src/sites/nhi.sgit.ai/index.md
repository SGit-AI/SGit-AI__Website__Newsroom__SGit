## Two populations, one question

| | Agents you run | Agents you rent |
|---|---|---|
| Where it executes | Your infrastructure | Somebody else's |
| Can you attest the workload? | Yes — that is the mechanism | **No** |
| Can you install an identity agent? | Yes | **No** |
| What you control | Everything | **The credential you hand over** |
| Industry answer | Mature, and expensive | **None** |

For the first population, an open standard (SPIFFE) issues short-lived cryptographic
identities based on workload attestation — described by practitioners as a multi-year
engineering project needing a dedicated team. For the second, the equivalent capability
is an open feature request. [The full argument, with citations](thesis/index.html).

## Hope is not a control

When you hand an agent a broad credential you are making two hopes: that it will not
misuse what it holds, and that it will not find the rest of what that credential
actually reaches. Neither hope changes your accountability.

## The research

Not a vendor list. One scenario (four agents, four vaults, one repository, nobody able
to use another's access), the same columns per option, privileges granted as the
differentiating column, a verification date on everything.

This site is published by the sgit project; vaults are a candidate answer to part of the
question studied here. [The participant disclosure, including where our own approach
