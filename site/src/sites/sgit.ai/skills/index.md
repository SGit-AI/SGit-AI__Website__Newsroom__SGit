# Skills, sgit for AI agents

A skill is a packaged set of instructions an AI agent loads to do a job well: the commands that matter, the patterns that work, the traps already hit and documented so the agent doesn't hit them again. sgit treats agents as first-class users, so its skills are first-class artifacts, versioned, verified against specific releases, and shipped right here in this vault.

## The three skills

## Operate

[use sgit and vaultsThe CLI end to end, and the cross-session pattern: clone/pull at session start, commit + push at session end, so state survives the context window. Includes the multi-agent branch-per-agent workflow.](use_sgit-and-vaults__SKILL.md)

## Build

[create vault appsThe vault-app playbook: the authoring contract, what the host gives you for free, proven layout patterns, the validation gate, and a nine-row table of failure modes with fixes, all bug-fixed against real vault behaviour.](create-vault-apps__SKILL.md)

## Author

[create vault contentStructured content without code: the full _page.json schema (embedded, no repo clone needed) and vault markdown authoring, with checklists and copy-paste templates.](create-vault-content__SKILL.md)

**Not yet in the skills: vault-to-vault messaging.** These three files ship verbatim from upstream and this site does not edit them. As of the current versions, the operate skill documents `sgit pki` as file signing and encryption, and does not mention [append lanes](../api/append-lanes.md), so an agent reading only the skill has both halves of the messaging mechanism and no statement that they combine. That is exactly the failure that produced [the messaging page](../docs/vault-messaging.md): an agent asked how to send a message between vaults and could not get there. Until the skill catches up, point agents at [/docs/vault-messaging](../docs/vault-messaging.md) alongside it.

## Installing a skill

For Claude Code and compatible agents: drop the skill file into your skills directory (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) or paste it into the session as context. The skill's own description tells the agent when to trigger it. A minimal bootstrap for a fresh session is one line:

```
$ pip install sgit-ai && sgit clone <vault-key> workspace
# then read skills/ inside any vault that ships them — like this one
```

The skills above are the canonical current versions, verified against sgit-ai v0.14.x and the current app-shell. They carry their own honesty markers, including which CLI commands are disabled right now and which platform features are trial-only, so an agent reading them gets ground truth, not marketing.

**Also for agents:** this site ships an [llms.txt](../llms.txt) at the vault root, the standard machine-readable index. Inside the vault it is encrypted like everything else (agents holding the key read it via `sgit cat llms.txt`); on a static deployment it becomes a plain public llms.txt. Same file, two trust contexts.
