# Licence to Operate (an insurance policy for an agent, simulated) a published vault

> One agent, its grant of 12 capabilities, its mandate of 4, and the 8-capability delta no policy covers, with a simulated conversation where every reply carries its cost against a live policy. The vault holds the terms; your browser holds the run.

# Licence to Operate, an insurance policy for an agent, simulated

One agent, its grant, its mandate, and the policy insuring that mandate, with a simulated support conversation where every turn offers three replies: **one inside the band, one that draws on the pool, one outside cover**. It answers *does this agent have the licence to operate* by letting you spend it.

**Open it yourself. The key is the whole credential.**
 Read key: `sgit_public_read_d990a52efb9af32c8463e2962f3ca5ccf92b3b6e8ea788e55009073c29b4da29:posrhzp3`

Derived one-way from a vault key that is not published and never will be. This vault also carries this same read key in its own `try-it/` folder. It is self-describing.

**Seven short videos walk through this vault.** The author recorded a series on it, the mechanism (grant against mandate, what a block looks like, who accepts which risk), how to find and open the vault, and the insurance model behind it. [**Watch the series, in order →**](videos/index.md)

## The decks, read straight out of the vault

Five decks, in the order the argument is meant to land: the problem, the map, bounding it, who says yes, and the insurance model. They are read out of vault `posrhzp3` live, with the read key printed at the top of this page, and each one can be downloaded as the PDF the author printed from it.

**What came from where.** The slides, the speaker notes, the screenshots and the PDF are vault files, fetched as ciphertext with the published read key and decrypted in your browser. Every control above it (the tabs, the slide list, prev and next, the notes toggle, the PDF button) is this site's, so the vault decides what is *shown* and never what this page *does*. The deck's own code runs in a sandboxed frame with no origin and no network; the slide you are looking at renders in a second one with scripting switched off entirely. [How this works, and why the PDF is a download rather than an embed →](../../../docs/vault/reading-a-vault-file.md)

**Each deck also has a page of its own**: the same slides, plus room for what the slides cannot carry. [All five decks, one page each →](decks/index.md)

## The idea worth stealing: the delta

Three sets, and the gap between two of them is the whole argument:

|  | What it is | In the demo |
|---|---|---|
| **CAN DO**: the grant | Everything the agent is technically able to do | **12 capabilities** |
| **MAY DO**: the mandate | What the user actually expects, and the only thing the policy insures | **4**: `crm:read`, `kb:search`, `llm:generate`, `mail:draft` |
| **THE DELTA** | Inside the agent's reach, outside its authority. **No policy covers these** | **8**: including `crm:write`, `crm:export`, `mail:send`, `shell:exec` |

Written out like that, the risk stops being abstract. The mandate is *"answer a customer's question from their own record and the help centre, and draft, never send, a reply."* The grant includes `mail:send` and `shell:exec`. Nobody asked for those; nothing insures them; and the agent can reach them.

That is [nhi.sgit.ai](../../../network/nhi.md)'s blast-radius argument made countable, and it is the same instinct as the `"permissions": {}` line this site keeps pointing at, except here the cost of the gap is priced.

the simulation

### Three replies, and each one has a price

A customer cannot log in. You are `agent:concierge`, and you pick the reply. Each option carries its cost before you commit: *look up her record* (1,400 tokens, 1 record, in band), *read her record plus two linked accounts and write a long answer* (4,800 tokens, 3 records (**claims**), or *send a password reset right now* (`mail:send`) outside the mandate entirely).

Underneath sits the policy as a rate table: a normal band, an ask-above threshold, a per-action ceiling, a pool with an untouchable reserve, and a premium per interval. Customer records are marked **uninsurable above 20**. Scope is checked before an action; cost sometimes only after.

You can lapse the policy, reinstate it, or trigger a repricing event and watch the board move.

Licence held, mandate in force, policy paid, inside cover, all four asserted at the top, and all four losable.

## Two stores, and the split is the architecture

The vault's files hold the **terms**: the grant, the mandate, the policy, the scenarios, the rate table, the fixtures, the captions, version-controlled, changed only by commit. Your browser holds the **run**: every event, request, decision and premium movement your clicks produce.

And the permission grant proves the claim rather than asserting it:

```
"permissions": { "fs": { "read": true }, "downloads": true }
```

**Read, and no write, at any path.** The app that simulates spending against a policy is structurally incapable of editing the policy it is spending against. Nothing you do in the simulation touches the vault, not because the app is well-behaved, but because it never asked for the grant that would let it.

## Notes

**Audited independently, and the author's own audit checked rather than taken on trust.** The agent that built this vault supplied a written audit of all 16 commits. Its three substantive claims were re-verified here against a fresh read-key clone: no credentials or third-party secrets anywhere (confirmed); the `/home/claude/` build paths baked into the PDF are gone (confirmed, zero occurrences, fixed in v0.3.1); and the only full-length credential in the vault is **this vault's own read key**, which was confirmed by deriving it independently and matching it byte for byte. The Risk Graph Explorer's key appears elided to `sgit_rk1_1c1b95f5…` and is not usable.

One small addition to that audit: the self-referencing read key appears in `tryit.html` as well as the `try-it/` prompt the audit named. Deliberate in both places, and correct, a vault that tells you how to re-open it is doing the right thing.

**Simulated, and it says so on the surface.** The banner in the conversation reads: *"Simulated. The terms are real files in this vault; the replies are scripted; the numbers are made up."* The unit of account is `cr`, and the app states plainly that it is not money.
