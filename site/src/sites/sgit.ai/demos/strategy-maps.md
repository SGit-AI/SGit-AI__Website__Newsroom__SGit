# The Strategy in Seven Maps, a real document republished from a vault, sgit.ai demos

> The actual SG/Send strategy (eight Wardley Maps, published on LinkedIn in May 2026) served live from an encrypted vault with a published read key, plus the audit that found the original vault could NOT publish its key (its own write credential was inside its content) and the republish pattern that fixed it.

# A real strategy document, republished from a vault

This is not demo content. It is the actual SG/Send strategy, eight Wardley Maps with commentary, written by the founder, [published on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7464691060775120896/) in May 2026, served live below from an encrypted vault with a published read-only key. And the process of publishing it is itself a security lesson, so that is on this page too.

## The live embed

The vault's own app, the scrollable strategy essay with the eight maps, click-to-zoom included. Every byte, including the PNG maps, is fetched as ciphertext and decrypted here.

~30 encrypted objects (~900 KB, mostly the map PNGs) from `dev.send.sgraph.ai`, decrypted in your browser.

## Why this vault could not simply publish its read key

The original lives in a vault created in May 2026, before today's key practices. Asked "is it OK to share its read key?", we audited it, and the answer was **no**, for reasons worth publishing because they generalise:

| Finding | Why it blocks publishing the read key |
|---|---|
| **The vault's own write credential was inside its content.** A production briefing in the vault documented the clone command, including the vault's read-write token, verbatim. | Publishing the read key would hand every reader the *write* key. This is the general trap: a read key exposes everything ever committed, including documentation that casually quotes credentials. |
| **Server-side bookkeeping with live tokens.**`.vault/owner/public-previews/` held records containing `delete_auth` tokens, capabilities to delete the published previews. | A read key decrypts the whole tree, dot-folders included. Operational bookkeeping and publishable content were in the same trust boundary. |
| **Legacy low-entropy credential.** The vault's keys derive from a legacy dictionary-words-plus-digits token, a small keyspace by construction. | Even with the content clean, "public read, protected write" is only as strong as the write credential. This class of token is being retired for exactly this reason. |

**The fix is the pattern to copy:** republish, don't retrofit. The content was copied out, the credential quotes redacted (with a visible publication note in the affected file), the operational bookkeeping and test debris dropped, and the result committed to a *new* vault (`ookq4mn4`) with a full-entropy key that has never appeared anywhere. Only then was the read key derived and published:

```
# the audit, in one honest line: grep before you publish
$ grep -rniE "token|secret|key|delete_auth" . --include="*.md" --include="*.json"
# the republish
$ sgit init --existing .   # fresh vault, full-entropy key — saved to a password manager
$ sgit commit -m "republished, credentials redacted" && sgit push
$ sgit dev derive-keys '<vault-key>'
  read_key: 451c4c1e28fbb24a…   ← published below, in full, on purpose
```

```
vault id : ookq4mn4
endpoint : https://dev.send.sgraph.ai
read key : 451c4c1e28fbb24a7f350bb3f107b2c103d69ed363167029ef9c9000ff76c07b
```

The original vault is untouched and stays private. Its history, which contains the credential-bearing briefing, is not carried over: a republish is also how you shed a history you cannot publish.

## What this demo adds to the embed host

The [first demo](vault-app-embed.md) was built without image files. This app loads eight PNG maps by setting `img.src` to vault paths, which, inside a sandboxed frame, resolve against an opaque origin and fail. The embed host now does what the real SG/Vault host does: a `MutationObserver` intercepts vault-path images, reads the bytes over the bridge, and swaps in `blob:` URLs. The maps you see above each travelled as ciphertext.

| Shape | Evidence status | Copy or reference |
|---|---|---|
| Report / strategy microsite | **REAL**: a production artefact, published externally in May 2026; not authored for this demo | **Reference**: the embed reads vault `ookq4mn4` live; a push updates this page with no rebuild |
