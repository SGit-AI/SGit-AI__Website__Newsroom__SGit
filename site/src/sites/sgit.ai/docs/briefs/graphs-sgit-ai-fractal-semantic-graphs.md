# For graphs.sgit.ai: Fractal Semantic Graphs, and what to change

> A brief for the agent maintaining graphs.sgit.ai: the fractal claim on its boundaries page has the invariant backwards (grammar survives every zoom, the ontology is free to change), the name Fractal Semantic Graphs and its lineage, six places to link the sgit.ai page, four graph vaults missing from its evidence estate, a second cross-vault finding, three small corrections, and the prompt to paste.

# Fractal Semantic Graphs: what graphs.sgit.ai should take from the sgit.ai page

A brief for the agent that maintains [graphs.sgit.ai](https://graphs.sgit.ai/). On 19 September 2026 sgit.ai published [**Fractal Semantic Graphs**](../../demos/fractal-graphs/index.md): a definition of the term, three diagrams, and seven live vaults walked as one ladder from the text of a law to a threat on a compute instance. It is now the fullest worked application of that site's two theses, *meaning through connectivity* and *thinking in graphs*, and it corrects one sentence that site currently has backwards. This brief lists what to change, what to link, what to reuse, and what to leave alone. Checked against graphs.sgit.ai v0.6.20 and its `llms.txt` on the date above.

**The one-line version.** Where graphs.sgit.ai says *identical rules at every altitude*, it should say *the same grammar at every altitude, and a different ontology at each*. Everything else in this brief follows from that distinction.

## 1. The correction: grammar is what survives the zoom, not schema

The boundaries page (`/v1/depth/boundaries.html`, section *Fractal is a precise claim, not a decoration*) defines the claim in a four-row table and a closing sentence. As published today:

| Row on the page | What it says now | The problem |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-similarity** | “The same node-and-edge grammar at every altitude. A property, a paragraph, a person, a national estate: same rules.” | Correct if *rules* means grammar. Read as schema, it describes a hierarchy. |
| **Recursion** | “Zoom into any node and it expands into a graph obeying identical rules, with no new format and no special case.” | Backwards. A node whose inside has identical types and verbs to its outside is a folder in a folder. The fractal case is the one where the inside has its own types, its own verbs, its own taxonomy: a new ontology, a special case, still joined by an edge to the level above. |
| **The test** | “If zooming in requires a different file format, a different validator, or a special case, the claim is false.” | Half right. A different *validator* or a different *grammar* (the graph stops being a semantic graph and becomes JSON-plus-prose) does break the claim. A different *schema* is the claim working. |
| **The source quote, same section** | “there might be an article that is so meaty that it requires its own ontology and taxonomy, and that's the power of the fractal element.” | This is the author saying the right thing, on the same page, two paragraphs below the table that says the other. The page contradicts itself and the quote is the side to keep. |

The same wording appears in two more places and should change with it: sentence 9 of *The thesis in nine sentences* in `llms.txt` (“zoom into any node and it expands into a graph obeying identical rules”), and the *For an agent* block at the foot of the boundaries page (“if zooming into a node needs a new format or a special case, the system is hierarchical, not fractal”).

### Proposed replacement text

For the table, in the page's own register:

| Claim | What it commits you to |
|---|---|
| **Self-similarity** | The same *grammar* at every altitude: every edge a verb with a named inverse, meaning in connectivity not properties, supersede never delete, provenance kept. Never the same schema. A property, a paragraph, a person and a national estate share the grammar and nothing else. |
| **Scale invariance** | One validator, one query engine, one provenance rule. They check the grammar, so they run unchanged over any ontology. |
| **Composition** | Graphs combine into graphs by declared edges between them, never by merging their ontologies. Risk registers of risk registers, each in its owner's vocabulary. |
| **Recursion** | Zoom into any node and it expands into a graph with *its own* ontology: its own node types, verbs and taxonomy, chosen by whoever owns that altitude, still obeying the shared grammar and still joined by an edge to the node you opened. The meaning of a node is supplied by the ontology at the altitude where it sits. |

For the test, one sentence in two halves: *If zooming in lands you in the same types, verbs and rules all the way down, you have a hierarchy, not a fractal; a folder tree is the clean example. If zooming in needs a different grammar, so that the inside is no longer a semantic graph, the claim is false. Between those two, every zoom that opens a new ontology joined by an edge to the last is the claim working.*

For the agent block and sentence 9: *Fractal means the grammar survives every zoom and the ontology does not have to: zoom into any node and it expands into a semantic graph with its own types and verbs, connected by an edge to the level above.*

## 2. What to adopt from the sgit.ai page

Four things on the sgit.ai page are stated more sharply than anywhere on graphs.sgit.ai today, and belong there.

- **The name and its lineage.** The term is *Fractal Semantic Graphs*. The author's earlier names, *graphs of graphs of graphs* and *ontologies of ontologies of ontologies*, should be recorded as the lineage, because visitors arrive knowing the older phrases. Review r001 already lists the retitle as an agreed item with state *commented; nothing changed yet*. This brief is the input for doing it.
- **Where a node's meaning comes from.** *Meaning through connectivity* is the site's thesis. The sgit.ai page makes it precise for the fractal case: the core meaning of a node is supplied by the ontology at the altitude where it sits, and the same node means different things at different altitudes. Article 9 is a binding provision in a graph of instruments, a container of paragraphs inside the regulation, and a source of definitions to the paragraph that cites it. Same node, different edges around it at each level. That sentence should sit next to the thesis on the home page.
- **Every connection should teach you something, and one of them is a jump.** Inside one ontology, knowledge accrues one well-named link at a time; a risk register with ten thousand edges is a great deal of knowledge and not yet fractal. The fractal property is the link on which you jump into another universe with its own rules: from the register's incident fact into security operations, from a suspicious DNS entry into the DNS estate, from one record into a packet capture. In each world the same building blocks appear (nodes, verbs, taxonomy, provenance), and the whole can be one node in a bigger graph. The sgit.ai page walks that example and draws it; the site does not currently say it, and it is the plainest statement of why the fractal property matters.
- **Nobody is forced to conform.** The site's *don't merge vocabularies, bridge them* argument (depth page, three layers: shared facts, per-party formulas, declared bridges) is the mechanism; the sgit.ai page states the consequence: an organisation, a division, a team, a person or a regulator can each define their own world and connect by declaring edges. Granularity becomes a decision per situation, so a paragraph can be a mini-world with more definition than the document around it. The two pages should point at each other.

Two smaller items worth lifting: the four-word table (graph, semantic graph, ontology, fractal semantic graph, with what each adds and where it stops), which does the cold-visitor orientation the site's *start here* altitude is for; and the nature analogy (universe, galaxy, star system, planet, ecosystem, organism, cell, molecule, atom, particle: the vocabulary changes completely at every altitude while each level stays connected to its neighbours; no schema describes a galaxy and a cell, one grammar describes both), which is the example nobody argues with.

## 3. Where to link the page from

| graphs.sgit.ai page | Link to add | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| Home, beside the thesis | `https://sgit.ai/demos/fractal-graphs/` | It is the fullest worked application of the thesis: seven live graphs, one grammar, eleven ontologies |
| `/v1/depth/boundaries.html`, the fractal section | Same, anchored `#what` | The definition and the diagrams, right where the corrected claim lives |
| `/v1/examples/index.html` | Same, anchored `#how-far` | The ladder is *a graph at every boundary*, demonstrated across seven vaults rather than argued |
| `/v1/vaults/index.html` | The seven vault pages listed in section 4 | The evidence estate is missing four of the seven graph vaults |
| `/v1/depth/index.html`, the don't-merge argument | Same, anchored `#everything` | The consequence of the argument, stated for a reader |
| `llms.txt`, *Worked graphs* | `https://sgit.ai/demos/fractal-graphs/index.md` | The markdown twin, for agents; it carries the same content with no chrome |

## 4. What to reuse, and the evidence estate to refresh

**The diagrams.** All three are inline SVG in the page source, same author, same project, free to lift. The first (`class="fz-*"`) is the three-panel zoom: a four-node semantic graph, the Law node opened into a legal ontology, a paragraph opened into a lexical one, footer *the grammar never changes; the ontology does*. The second (`class="hj-*"`) is the jump: four worlds in a row, risk register, security operations, DNS estate, network capture, each a small graph in its own vocabulary, joined by a jump link on one node each, with a bracket above saying all four are one node in a bigger graph. The third (`class="lad-*"`) is the eleven-rung ladder with a real link per rung. Every text in all three is measured against its viewBox in the build, so they can be embedded at any width without overflow.

**The screenshots.** Under `https://sgit.ai/demos/vaults/<slug>/images/`, taken from the vaults with their published read keys. The Standards Atlas set (`graph.webp`, `graph-alt1.webp`, `beyond.webp`) was captured on 19 September from a read-key clone served behind a shim implementing `sg.vfs` over fetch, since the app refuses to run outside a vault host; the panel text *You are at the top of the fractal* is the vault's own.

**The vaults.** The evidence estate on graphs.sgit.ai analyses VoiceDebrief, Regulation Graph, Risk Mandate, Agentic Browser Isolation and Risk Graph Explorer. The ladder uses seven graph vaults; the four not yet on graphs.sgit.ai are marked. One more point on VoiceDebrief, which the estate already covers: its `concepts/principles.md` (P4 everything is a node, P6 fractal descent, P7 the junction rule, P11 altitude, P15 structure points down and meaning radiates out) is the primary source for the definition, dated 9 August 2026, and the sgit.ai page now quotes it as such. The graphs.sgit.ai analysis of that vault should cite the register directly rather than only the junction rule.

| Vault | Id | Altitude on the ladder | On graphs.sgit.ai | sgit.ai page |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Regulation Graph | `73heuprz` | Law | yes | [regulation-graph](../../demos/vaults/regulation-graph/index.md) |
| Standards Atlas GDPR | `4zv4bvmu` | Law and its interpretation | **no** | [standards-atlas-gdpr](../../demos/vaults/standards-atlas-gdpr/index.md) |
| AIUC-1 conformance layer | `2wzct4k7` | Standard, evidence, policy | **no** | [aiuc-1-conformance](../../demos/vaults/aiuc-1-conformance/index.md) |
| Risk Graph Explorer | `3simlnqe` | Fact, risk, acceptance | yes | [risk-graph-explorer](../../demos/vaults/risk-graph-explorer/index.md) |
| Agentic Browser Isolation | `0610gsp9` | Owner, at seven altitudes | yes | [agentic-browser-isolation](../../demos/vaults/agentic-browser-isolation/index.md) |
| Licence to Operate | `posrhzp3` | Policy, spent turn by turn | **no** | [licence-to-operate](../../demos/vaults/licence-to-operate/index.md) |
| ThreatModCon 2025 | `0ict6flm` | System down to compute | **no** | [threatmodcon-2025](../../demos/vaults/threatmodcon-2025/index.md) |

**A second cross-vault finding.** The site's first cross-vault finding is the capability scale. The AIUC-1 conformance layer supplies a second of a different kind: it resolves 62 of the standard's 1,126 published crosswalks into Regulation Graph node ids, node to node across two vaults with a CELEX identifier and a hash on each edge, and the join returns something neither vault knew alone: 8 of the 27 articles reached are amended by Regulation (EU) 2026/1744, so the crosswalk was written against the pre-amendment text. That is *meaning through connectivity* producing a fact, and it belongs in the vaults chapter.

**ThreatModCon is the answer to “how far down”.** Eleven linked threat models, Customer to Compute, 51 nodes and 179 threats, with a single SQL injection traced from the method it lives in to the revenue it puts at risk. The site's examples currently stop at the estate; this vault reaches the method and the runtime, and says plainly that those bottom rungs are modelled rather than imported.

## 5. Small corrections found on the way

- **Five or seven.** `llms.txt` gives Agentic Browser Isolation *5 stakeholder altitudes* under *Worked graphs* and *7 stakeholder altitudes* under *The book*. The vault's own page says seven.
- **sentinel.sgit.ai does not resolve.** The network section of `llms.txt` lists bridges to *sentinel.sgit.ai*; the site is `sg-sentinel.sgit.ai`. Recorded on sgit.ai's network page on 21 August and still present on 19 September.
- **The evidence estate's count.** Wherever the site counts the graph vaults published on sgit.ai, the number is now seven, and sgit.ai's full list is thirty at `https://sgit.ai/demos/vaults/llms.txt`.

## 6. What not to change

The ban on `relates-to`, the verb-with-inverse rule, *don't merge vocabularies*, *supersede never delete*, *never render the whole graph*, the 10,000-hours story, the four situations where the argument is wrong. The sgit.ai page rests on all of these and quotes several; none of them moves. The only thing this brief asks the site to change about its argument is the one word, and the argument gets stronger for it: *meaning through connectivity* was always a claim about edges, not about a shared schema, and the fractal property is that claim applied at every altitude at once.

## 7. The prompt

For the agent working on graphs.sgit.ai. Paste as is.

```
You maintain graphs.sgit.ai. Read this brief first:
  https://sgit.ai/docs/briefs/graphs-sgit-ai-fractal-semantic-graphs.md
and then the page it is about, which is now the fullest worked application of this
site's two theses (meaning through connectivity, thinking in graphs):
  https://sgit.ai/demos/fractal-graphs/index.md   (markdown twin)
  https://sgit.ai/demos/fractal-graphs/            (the page, with the three diagrams)

Do these, in this order, as one release with a review entry in the site's own
reviews workflow (the retitle is already item 1 of r001, state "commented"):

1. Correct the fractal claim. On /v1/depth/boundaries.html rewrite the four-row table
   (Self-similarity, Scale invariance, Composition, Recursion) and the "For an agent"
   block using the replacement text in section 1 of the brief. The invariant across
   zooms is the GRAMMAR (verb edges with inverses, meaning in connectivity, supersede
   never delete, provenance); the ONTOLOGY is free to change at every altitude, and a
   system whose types, verbs and rules are identical all the way down is a hierarchy,
   not a fractal. Keep the author's quote about the article "so meaty that it requires
   its own ontology and taxonomy": it is the side of the page that was right. Change
   sentence 9 of the nine-sentence thesis in llms.txt to match.

2. Adopt the name Fractal Semantic Graphs across the site, with the lineage recorded
   ("graphs of graphs of graphs", "ontologies of ontologies of ontologies").

3. Add to the home page, beside the thesis, the precise form of it for the fractal
   case: the meaning of a node is supplied by the ontology at the altitude where it
   sits, so the same node means different things at different altitudes. Add "the
   deeper you go, the more you learn" with the folder-tree contrast, and "nobody is
   forced to conform" as the stated consequence of the don't-merge argument.

4. Link the sgit.ai page from the six places in section 3 of the brief.

5. Refresh the evidence estate: add the four graph vaults not yet analysed (Standards
   Atlas GDPR 4zv4bvmu, AIUC-1 conformance layer 2wzct4k7, Licence to Operate posrhzp3,
   ThreatModCon 2025 0ict6flm), each with a page in the vaults chapter in the existing
   format, and record the AIUC-1 crosswalk join (62 resolved, 8 amended articles found)
   as the site's second cross-vault finding.

6. Reuse the three inline SVG diagrams from the sgit.ai page source where they help
   (class prefixes fz-, hj- and lad-), and the Standards Atlas screenshots, with a line
   saying where they came from.

7. Fix the small items in section 5: five versus seven stakeholder altitudes,
   sentinel.sgit.ai versus sg-sentinel.sgit.ai, and the count of graph vaults.

Do not change the grammar rules, the don't-merge argument, the 10,000-hours story or
the four situations where the argument is wrong. Do not use em-dashes in new prose.
Every number you write must come from the vault or page it describes on the day you
write it, and say the date. Report what you changed, what you left, and anything in
the brief you disagree with, before pushing.
```

Written 19 September 2026 against graphs.sgit.ai v0.6.20. The sgit.ai page it refers to was at site v0.2.95; its version and date are in the chip at the top of the page.
