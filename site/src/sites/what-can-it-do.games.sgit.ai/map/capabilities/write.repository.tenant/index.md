# Push to a code host (any branch it can reach)

`write.repository.tenant` — **write** × **repository** at **tenant** reach (the organisation's accounts, repositories and services). Family: code. Effect: **recoverable from a backup, a history or a revert, at a cost**.

## What narrows it

**The setting:** a branch protection rule at the host — the agent cannot edit it — and a pre-push hook in the clone for the earlier, cheaper refusal

**What it costs:** minutes; and a review step before anything deploys

**Tier after:** boundary (host rule) · setting (hook)

## Questions that ask about it
