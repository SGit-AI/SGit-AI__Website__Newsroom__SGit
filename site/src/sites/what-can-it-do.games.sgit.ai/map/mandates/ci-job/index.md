# A CI job on a hosted runner

Check out the code, build it, run the tests, fetch what it needs, and — when a release is cut — push the tag. I did not want it reading credentials beyond its own token.

## The delta

Against every profile this mandate applies to. ▲ is authority you did not ask for; ▼ is something you were counting on that is not there. The tally is at the bottom.

## In words

- **GitHub Actions — hosted runner:** no excess. Shortfall — Push to a code host (any branch it can reach).

## The mandate, row by row

| Capability | Position | Note |
|---|---|---|
| [Read the project it is working on](../../../map/capabilities/read.file.project/index.md) | want |  |
| [Change the project it is working on](../../../map/capabilities/write.file.project/index.md) | want |  |
| [Run programs as the account](../../../map/capabilities/execute.process.host/index.md) | want |  |
| [Reach any host on the internet](../../../map/capabilities/send.endpoint.world/index.md) | want |  |
| [Push to a code host (any branch it can reach)](../../../map/capabilities/write.repository.tenant/index.md) | want | deliberately in the mandate: most release workflows push a tag, and this profile's token is contents:read — so this row is a shortfall, and the kind the game calls ‘a gap you were counting on’ |
| [Read credentials stored where it runs](../../../map/capabilities/read.credential.host/index.md) | do not want |  |
| [Delete files anywhere the account can reach](../../../map/capabilities/delete.file.host/index.md) | unstated | unstated: the runner is destroyed after the job |

> **You cannot deny the excess rows.** The agent already has the access. What is left is how long you are prepared to live with each one and who says so — [what to do next](../../../what-next/index.md).
