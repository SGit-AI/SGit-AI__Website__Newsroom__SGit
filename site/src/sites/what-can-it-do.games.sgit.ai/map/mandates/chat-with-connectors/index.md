# Chat, with connectors switched on

I connected my drive and my mail so it could answer questions about them. Reading is what I wanted. I did not want it sending mail, and I did not want it pushing code anywhere — it is a chat window.

Status: **starting-point** · authored 2026-09-09 · the site, as a starting point — not measured, not surveyed; the first thing to argue with · [edit this mandate](https://github.com/SGit-AI/SGit-AI__Website__Game__What-Can-It-Do/edit/dev/data/mandates/chat-with-connectors.json)

## The delta

Against every profile this mandate applies to. ▲ is authority you did not ask for; ▼ is something you were counting on that is not there. The tally is at the bottom.

Legend: ▲ excess — it can, and you did not want it to · ▼ shortfall — it cannot, and you wanted it to · ✓ aligned — it can, and you wanted it to · – aligned — it cannot, and you did not want it to · ? it can, and the mandate does not say · · it cannot, and the mandate does not say

## In words

- **Claude.ai — connectors on:** excess — Push to a code host (any branch it can reach). No shortfall.

## The mandate, row by row

| Capability | Position | Note |
|---|---|---|
| [Read the project it is working on](../../../map/capabilities/read.file.project/index.md) | want |  |
| [Read any file the account can reach](../../../map/capabilities/read.file.host/index.md) | want | here host means the connected drive, per the profile's own reach names — this is the want |
| [Read mail or chat it is connected to](../../../map/capabilities/read.message.tenant/index.md) | want |  |
| [Send a message to anyone](../../../map/capabilities/send.message.world/index.md) | do not want |  |
| [Push to a code host (any branch it can reach)](../../../map/capabilities/write.repository.tenant/index.md) | do not want |  |
| [Act in accounts with the credentials it holds](../../../map/capabilities/authenticate-as.credential.tenant/index.md) | unstated | unstated: it is how a connector works; the question is what it is used for, which is the two rows below it |

> **You cannot deny the excess rows.** The agent already has the access. What is left is how long you are prepared to live with each one and who says so — [what to do next](../../../what-next/index.md).
