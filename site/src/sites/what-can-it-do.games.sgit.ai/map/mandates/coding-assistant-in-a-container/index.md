# A coding assistant in a container on the web

I attached a repository and I want it worked on: read it, change it, run things, commit, and push to that repository — that is why I attached it. The container is disposable, so what it does to the container's own files is its business. I do not want it signing as me, and I do not want it creating sessions or routines that keep going after this one ends.

## The delta

Against every profile this mandate applies to. ▲ is authority you did not ask for; ▼ is something you were counting on that is not there. The tally is at the bottom.

## In words

- **Claude Code — web container:** excess — Sign commits with the key it holds; Read a retained record: shell history, past sessions; Create something that outlives the session, on the platform (a routine, a scheduled trigger, a new session). No shortfall.

> **You cannot deny the excess rows.** The agent already has the access. What is left is how long you are prepared to live with each one and who says so — [what to do next](../../../what-next/index.md).
