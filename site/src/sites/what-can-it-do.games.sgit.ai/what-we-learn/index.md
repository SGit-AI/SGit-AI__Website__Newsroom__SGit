# What we learn from you

The game counts usage anonymously while you play. Here is exactly what is in those counts, what is deliberately left out, and how to stop it. Nothing on this page is a summary of something less flattering.

> This game counts usage anonymously — which screens people reach, which answers are common. No cookies, no analytics script, nothing that identifies you or your machine, and a pause switch on every screen. [What is sent](../what-we-learn/index.md).

## How much is this, really?

**Less than almost every other site you will open today.** No cookies. No analytics script — no Google Analytics, no tag manager, no third-party pixel of any kind. No account, because there is nothing to sign up for. No fingerprinting. Not even the page you came from.

It is less than a **default web-server access log**, which by default records your IP address, the exact page, the time, your full browser string and the site that referred you, for every request, on essentially every website in existence.

So why the notice at all? Not because this is invasive — it is not. Because the thing the game is published *inside* normally sends nothing anywhere, and a departure from that promise gets stated plainly wherever the game appears. It would be strange to write a game about knowing what software does on your behalf and then be vague about what this one does.

## What is sent

- **Which screens you reached** — that you started, got to question 12, finished.
- **The answers you gave** and the points they scored.
- **Which setup you picked** from the list of nine — the *public* option you chose, meaning “Claude Code on a machine”, not anything about your machine.
- **A session id**: sixteen random characters made up in memory when the page opened and gone when you close the tab. It links your answers within one sitting and to nothing else, ever.
- **A rough form factor** — phone or desktop — and a language.

## What is deliberately not sent

- **No name, no email, no account** — the game has none to send.
- **No fingerprint.** No browser fingerprinting of any kind. The sender *can* compute one; the switch that would turn it on (`signals` in the vault's `telemetry/telemetry.config.json`) is **off** in the game's vault at v1.2.0 (checked 2026-09-09), and the vault's own telemetry page says so. The release gate refuses a build where this sentence and the vault's config disagree.
- **No URL and no referrer** — not the page you came from, not the link you followed.
- **Not your full browser string, not your screen size.**
- **Nothing you type.** The game has a chat panel; the fact that you used it is counted, the words are not sent and are not stored.

## How to stop it

Every screen has a **pause switch** next to the notice, and it works before the first question. Nothing is sent while it is paused. You do not need to give a reason and nothing about you is remembered for the next visit — because nothing about you is remembered at all.

## What it can and cannot prove

> **It proves nothing about anyone, and that is by design.** The game is published openly, so the token it uses to send events is public too — anyone could forge or flood the lane. So we treat every event as a claim, not as a fact. It is enough to see that people get stuck on question 12; it is not evidence about any person and could never be used as any. Sessions are tabs, not people.

## The second lane: when you press 👍 or 👎

Feedback you deliberately give travels separately from the counting, and nothing is sent unless you press something. It is kept apart so that the counting can be deleted without losing what people actually said.

What comes back out of it is public: disagreements are turned into positions and published, and **a question you argued with then carries our answer** for the next person who reaches it. Nobody is named and nobody's words are quoted unless they were deliberately marked as quotable. [How that works](https://games.sgit.ai/games/ideas.html).

## This site itself

No analytics, no cookies, no tracking pixels, no server. It is static files. The only thing that sends anything is the game, in its frame, on the lanes described above.
