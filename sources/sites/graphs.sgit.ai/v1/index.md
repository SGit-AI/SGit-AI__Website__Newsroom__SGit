# graphs.sgit.ai — a node is just a node; meaning lives in the edges

> "in our graph we do not use properties, because properties do not have meaning, they are
> just words; **we capture meaning through connectivity.**"

*Source: <https://graphs.sgit.ai/index.html> · site v0.4.0 · markdown twin of the front page.*

**Not a graph database pitch.** The claim is that one grammar is the interface at every
boundary, not that we store things in a graph. There is no graph database anywhere in the
work behind this site, and [we say so on its own page](shipped/index.html).

## The one that needs no background

Two variables in a Python program. Both hold `8080`.

| | Reached by tracing outward |
|---|---|
| `port = 8080` | `int`. That is the whole graph. |
| `port = Safe_UInt__Port(8080)` | a type carrying a range constraint → a library → a pinned version → its tests, repository, licence, maintainer |

**The difference is not in the value.** The meaning is identical in the developer's head and
radically different in the graph — and the graph is what another system, another team, or an
agent has to work from. [The five-minute version](start/index.html).

## Three altitudes

| | Section | What you leave with |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — the city walls** | [/start/](start/index.html) | A node alone means nothing; the same value differently connected means different things; nobody has to agree for the overlap to be computable; confidence is a function of connectivity; a named absence beats a hidden one. |
| **2 — roads and buildings** | [/grammar/](grammar/index.html) | Every edge is a verb with a distinct inverse. The generic association edge is banned. Paths must read as sentences. Rich nodes are good. Never render the whole graph — render the result of a query. |
| **3 — people and cars** | [/depth/](depth/index.html) | Against schema-first; merging vocabularies erases the disagreement; classification as a computed path-pattern; the grounding ladder; supersede never delete; concepts not words. Plus [a graph at every boundary](depth/boundaries.html). |

The IA is the argument: *"this is just a question of altitude, like if you see something from a
very high altitude you just see the city walls, and as you zoom in you start to see roads and
buildings, and eventually people and cars."*

## The story that makes the case

Expertise takes **10,000 hours** — from a 1993 violin study, where it was an *average*, not a
threshold, and half the top group had not reached it. The original author spent his career
correcting the popularisation, and **none of the corrections ever attached to the claim**: by
then it had been carried through **242 papers** and more than **200,000 supporting citation
paths** that lead back to nothing.

A document cannot fix that. A graph can: mark the claim superseded from a date, then ask which
conclusions were resting on it. [Supersede, never delete](depth/index.html#supersede).

## Real numbers

| Graph | Numbers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [EU AI Act regulation graph](https://sgit.ai/demos/vaults/regulation-graph/) | **1,523 nodes · 1,944 edges**; 11 views; RDF/Turtle export | live vault |
| [Risk Graph Explorer](https://sgit.ai/demos/vaults/risk-graph-explorer/) | 18 facts / 37 risks / 14 provisions; `permissions: {}` | live vault |
| [Agentic browser isolation](https://sgit.ai/demos/vaults/agentic-browser-isolation/) | 17 entry points; 5 stakeholder altitudes | live vault |
| [Browser isolation risk graph](examples/browser-isolation.html) | **59 nodes, 75 edges** — including 3 risks *of the mitigation* | parsed from the brief |
| [The 2FA instance graph](examples/2fa.html) | **51 nodes, 53 edges**, one machine-readable file | parsed from the brief |
| The issue tracker's own graph | **71 nodes, 141 edges**; 12 node types, 10 edge types | measured, live repo data |

[All worked examples](examples/index.html).

## What ships, and what is argued

Ships and is verifiable by reading code: a content-addressed commit DAG with multi-parent
commits, a real wave-BFS merge-base and three-way merge; a graph of graphs via typed
`*.link.json` edges; a read-only DAG query API exposed to untrusted sandboxed apps; a live
typed property graph; three published vaults.

Does not exist anywhere: **any graph database**, MGraph-DB as a dependency, browser SPARQL or
Cypher, RDF/JSON-LD in the code, the path-query language, commit signing (written, and only
ever `null`).

> *"We ship a hand-written content-addressed object graph in the browser. We do not use a graph
> database, and we say so in our own architecture notes."*

[The full separation](shipped/index.html).

## Why this site exists

The three canonical philosophy documents sit in `library/concepts/`, are referenced by four
files, and are **not referenced from the file every agent starts from**. An agent reading it and
working forwards never encounters the philosophy. That is a routing failure, not a comprehension
failure — so the fix is an address. [Origins, and the ten-phase arc](origins/index.html).

## Read it as a book

The site's content is also a book — **Meaning Through Connectivity**, an introduction and sixteen chapters in
six parts, generated from the site's own pages so the two cannot drift:

- [Chapter pages, with the table of contents beside you](book/index.html)
- [The whole book in one page](book/single.html)
- [The print PDF](book/meaning-through-connectivity.pdf) — a 6″×9″ technical-book interior with gutters, folios and a paginated contents; print-on-demand ready — [cover included](book/cover/front.svg)
- [The screen PDF](book/meaning-through-connectivity-screen.pdf) — the site's own design at US Letter, made for reading on a tablet

Both PDFs regenerate together from the same chapters on every release and carry the site
version on their cover — the build fails if either lags the content.

## For agents

- [llms.txt](../llms.txt) — every entry carries the page's single most important fact, not its topic
- [llms-full.txt](../llms-full.txt) — the whole document set in one fetch
- [/briefs/](documents/index.html) — the raw markdown, which is the source of truth
- [The edge set](grammar/edge-set.html) — the pasteable vocabulary

## Site

- [Glossary](glossary/index.html) — plain English alongside every technical term
- [Why graphs at all](why-graphs/index.html) — including GraphRAG and RDF positioning
- [The network](network/index.html) · [Origins](origins/index.html) · [The documents](documents/index.html)
- [Comms: tasks & requests](../admin/comms.html) · [Release history](../admin/versions.html) · [How this site is built](../admin/index.html)
