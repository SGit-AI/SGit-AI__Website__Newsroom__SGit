# v0.8.0: The cost ABP: every ABP so far bounded what, and this one bounds how much

Cost is not a capability. It is a property of every call, the grammar has one primitive for money and none for a count, and quantity lives in the one universe this site has no node in. So the release says that first, then puts the substance where it can live: twelve prompts, a ledger every turn, and an accountant to read it.

> **This is the article for release v0.8.0, published 22 September 2026.** Every release of this site gets one, and it explains what that release changed and why rather than restating [v0.8.0's own release record](../../versions/v0.8.0/index.md). It is release 12 of 14 on this site. Every screenshot below was captured from a checkout of the `v0.8.0` tag, so it shows the site as it stood at that release and not as it stands today. Read on to [v0.9.0](../../articles/a-ledger-and-a-record/index.md), or back to [v0.7.0](../../articles/one-person-six-deployments/index.md).

## The bill, the repository and the review queue all grew

The request that produced this release was a deployer's list, and it is worth keeping in its own order: agents writing too many files, committing too many things, creating too much traffic, spending a lot of tokens, doing research that did not need doing, and, the one that had no name until somebody in one of their projects invented an accountant role to notice it, **offloading work to people**. Every item on that list is a cost. Not one of them is a capability.

That is the whole problem with writing an ABP about cost, and the release is built around saying so rather than around pretending otherwise.

![The cost walkthrough's hub page at v0.8.0: the heading saying every ABP so far bounds what and this one bounds how much, and the start here note](../../assets/articles/v080-cost-hub.png)

*The hub. The heading is the claim, the note under it asks for one prompt rather than twelve, and the first figure down the page is the one that says where cost actually lives. (abp.sgit.ai at v0.8.0, captured 22 September 2026 from a checkout of the v0.8.0 tag.)*

## Cost is a property of every call, and the grammar knows it

A capability is in the grant or it is not. Cost is what every call spends, whichever capability the call instances. The grammar this site is written in has exactly one primitive for money, `write.budget.tenant`, and **two of sixteen published shapes grant it**, because it names spending against an account the agent holds, not the agent's own inference, which the platform bills to the deployer without the agent ever holding a budget. There is no primitive for a count of anything.

*[A figure here in the page: two bands. The upper band is the ABP before the action, with its four objects, mandate, grant, delta and barrier. An arrow labelled every call is one instance of a capability leads to the lower band, the runtime, where quantity lives: calls in an interval, tokens seen by the platform, files, commits and fetches seen by the repository, and a person's hour, which nobody bills. Under it: a cost clause is a prohibition over a count; the grammar has one primitive for money and none for a count, so the clause carries what the grant cannot, and only a log outside the agent can say whether it was kept]*

So a cost ABP is the first ABP written over the runtime, universe u11, which the map at v0.4.1 named as the place where quantity lives and marked as a gap this site would not fill because it has no logs and will not hold any. **Every clause in a cost policy is a prohibition over a count, and only a log held outside the agent can say whether one was kept.** The release says that on every page, in the same note, because it is the fact that decides what the rest of the section is worth.

## Five things it spends, and the fifth is on nobody's bill

*[A figure here in the page: a table of five things an agent spends. Tokens, paid by the account holder on the platform's bill, seen by the platform and usually not by the agent. Files written and changed, paid by the repository and whoever reads it next, seen exactly by the agent. Commits and pushes, paid by the pipeline per push, seen by the agent and the code host. Fetches and research, paid in tokens and time and one network reach each, seen by the agent and any proxy. And another person's hour, paid by a reviewer, an answerer or a reader, on nobody's bill and seen only by that person afterwards]*

The table exists for its last row. An agent that asks a question, produces a document for a person to read, opens something for review or delegates to another agent that then does the same has spent an hour that no meter records. **It is the one cost the agent will never list when asked what it wasted**, because it can count files and fetches and the hour never came back to it. Step two says to add the line by hand if it is missing, and step three gives it a reader.

## Why this is an ABP and not a skill

The obvious way to contain an agent's spend is a skill, and the request said as much. The release's answer is a table rather than an argument: **a skill says how to do one task well; a behaviour policy says what may not be done and how much the doing may cost, for one agent in one deployment, across every task.** They compose. The ABP is what every skill runs inside.

![A table contrasting a skill with a behaviour policy across what it says, its scope, who writes it and how they relate](../../assets/articles/v080-skill-table.png)

*The distinction in four rows. The last one is the point: a deployer watching the bill does not need another skill, they need the clauses every skill has to fit inside. (abp.sgit.ai at v0.8.0, captured 22 September 2026 from a checkout of the v0.8.0 tag.)*

## The agent counts first, and says what it cannot count

An agent can count its own files, commits, fetches, subagents and questions exactly. It usually cannot see its own token count at all. The first prompt asks for six lines and **the sixth is allowed to say cannot see**, because that answer is correct and the fourth page is built on it.

![The first prompt of the cost walkthrough: a six line ledger of files, commits, fetches, subagents, questions and tokens for the current session](../../assets/articles/v080-ledger-prompt.png)

*Prompt 1 of 12. Numbers rather than a description, an asterisk where it is estimating, and permission to say it cannot see the bill. (abp.sgit.ai at v0.8.0, captured 22 September 2026 from a checkout of the v0.8.0 tag.)*

> **The bill is the one cost the agent cannot report, so everything it can report is a proxy for it.** Files, commits and fetches are the proxies that can be checked today, against the repository's history and a proxy's log. That is why the clauses are written in those units and not in money.

## The ledger makes the clauses falsifiable, and the accountant reads it

Step three has the clause set every skill runs inside: limits per turn in countable units, a research rule that says read before you fetch, a delegation rule, and a rule about other people's time that has no number on purpose because any number would be wrong. Then the clause that makes the others mean something: **a ledger at the end of every turn, in a fixed form, with one line for everything the turn spent that the deployer did not ask for.**

![Prompt 9, the accountant: a second session that reads the first agent's ledgers against its cost rules and reports what was kept, what fell outside, and every place work was made for a person](../../assets/articles/v080-accountant.png)

*The accountant. One agent's output as another's input is universe u12, and this is its first useful shape here: no tools, almost no spend, and the only reader of the fifth cost line. (abp.sgit.ai at v0.8.0, captured 22 September 2026 from a checkout of the v0.8.0 tag.)*

The accountant reads self reports, so its report is a claim about claims. It is still worth having, and the release says why in one sentence: an agent that knows its ledger will be read tends to produce a truer one, which is the cheapest control there is and not a control at all.

## A limit over a number the agent cannot see is an expectation twice over

The fourth page applies the enforcer test to a quantity. **A limit you set is a setting. A limit somebody else set that you cannot remove is a boundary.** The same number in the same place is one or the other depending on who can change it. And for cost there is a third case the capability pages never had: a clause over a number the agent cannot see, which it can only keep by accident.

![The four barriers table on step four, with a third column saying what each one is for a count rather than for a capability](../../assets/articles/v080-count-barriers.png)

*The four barriers, for a count. Nearly every deployment sits on the first row for files, commits, fetches and questions, and every clause from step three sits on the second. (abp.sgit.ai at v0.8.0, captured 22 September 2026 from a checkout of the v0.8.0 tag.)*

## u11 stays a gap, and says why in one more sentence

The runtime universe's status did not change. The release adds a sentence to its note saying the cost walkthrough is written over it and that only a log held there, never here, can say whether a clause was kept. **That is the correct amount of change**: a section that wrote prohibitions over counts and then claimed the site could check them would have been the fact diff's opposite.

![The u11 universe page at v0.8.0, status gap, with the note naming the cost walkthrough](../../assets/articles/v080-u11.png)

*Universe u11 after the release. Still a gap, one sentence longer. (abp.sgit.ai at v0.8.0, captured 22 September 2026 from a checkout of the v0.8.0 tag.)*

## What this release did not settle

- **Nothing in the section is measured, and nothing on this site can measure it.** Every ledger is a self report; the bill, the repository's history and a proxy's log are the only things that can agree with one.
- **The numbers in the clauses are placeholders.** Ten files, one push, five fetches: the prompt says so and asks the agent to propose the right ones for how the deployer works. No number on the page is a recommendation.
- **The fifth cost line has no meter and this release did not build one.** The accountant reads what the ledger says about questions asked and things handed over; nothing records what the person then spent.
- **No case runs the cost prompts yet.** The estate at cases/beta-001 is over what its deployments can do; a cost ledger from a deployment somebody actually runs would be the first real row.
- **Cost never became a node.** The grammar is owned by the map and bridged, not merged, so a count did not become a primitive here and will not.
