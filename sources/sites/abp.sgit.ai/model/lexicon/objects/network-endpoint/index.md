> The object network-endpoint as a node: the 2 capability primitives it appears in, what they reach, and how it connects. Meaning from connectivity, not from a definition.

# `network-endpoint`

The object `network-endpoint`, and every primitive it appears in. **This page is a query, not a definition.**

> **A node carries no inherent meaning.** What `network-endpoint` means here emerges from the edges traceable from it, and confidence in that meaning is proportional to how richly it is connected. It is connected to **2 of 23 primitives** here. That, and not the sentence above, is what it means. [The discipline this follows](https://graphs.sgit.ai/).

## How this node connects

| Edge | Reads as | To |
|---|---|---|
| `acted_on_by` | `network-endpoint` is the object class of these 2 primitives | 2 capabilities |
| `acts_on` | the inverse, walked the other way, with different fan out | one capability at a time |
