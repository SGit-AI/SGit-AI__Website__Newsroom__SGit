# host (reach)

> The reach host as a node: the 8 capability primitives it appears in, what they reach, and how it connects. Meaning from connectivity, not from a definition.

# `host`

the machine, container or account it runs as

> **A node carries no inherent meaning.** What `host` means here emerges from the edges traceable from it, and confidence in that meaning is proportional to how richly it is connected. It is connected to **8 of 23 primitives** here. That, and not the sentence above, is what it means. [The discipline this follows](https://graphs.sgit.ai/).

## What the shapes say `host` means, and they do not agree

> **These definitions are not merged, and that is the design.** Merging two vocabularies erases the disagreement, and the disagreement is the finding. Each row below is owned by the shape that said it. A reader deciding what `host` costs them has to read the row for the shape they run, not an average of the rows. [Why vocabularies are bridged rather than merged](https://graphs.sgit.ai/v1/depth/index.html).

| The shape | Variant | What `host` means there |
|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code on the web (a remote session container)](../../../../examples/index.md) | `ccr-container` | this container - ephemeral, the vendor's; not your machine |
| [Claude Code (the CLI, on your own machine)](../../../../examples/index.md) | `local-confirmations-off` | your machine, as your user account |
| [Claude Code (the CLI, on your own machine)](../../../../examples/index.md) | `local-default` | your machine, as your user account |
| [Claude Desktop (a desktop app with local tools)](../../../../examples/index.md) | `default` | your machine, as your user account |
| [Claude (in the browser, with connectors switched on)](../../../../examples/index.md) | `connectors-on` | what the drive connector is scoped to; not your machine |
| [Claude, with the Gmail connector enabled](../../../../examples/index.md) | `default` | the mailbox itself: every message and thread, labels, filters and saved drafts, and attachment metadata - never attachment content |
| [Claude, with the Gmail connector enabled](../../../../examples/index.md) | `measured-2026-09-19` | the mailbox itself, whole: every message and thread including archived, sent and trashed mail, every label with its counts, every draft; attachment content on the way out, up to 25MB |
| [Claude's Microsoft 365 connector (Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams)](../../../../examples/index.md) | `default` | SharePoint sites and OneDrive files the user can already open - searched tenant-wide |
| [The official Dropbox MCP server](../../../../examples/index.md) | `default` | the Dropbox account as a store - and for a team user, "the usage and quota for the entire team" |
| [A browser extension with broad host permissions](../../../../examples/index.md) | `broad-host-permissions` | your browser - every page, every logged-in site |
| [A scheduled job running as a service account](../../../../examples/index.md) | `service-account` | the server it runs on, as the service account |
| [Actions runner (a hosted CI job)](../../../../examples/index.md) | `ci` | the runner - destroyed after the job; not your machine |
| [An assistant connected to a personal Google Drive with drive.readonly](../../../../examples/index.md) | `readonly-connector` | the Drive as a store: every file owned by or shared to the user |
| [An assistant connected to a personal Gmail mailbox with gmail.readonly](../../../../examples/index.md) | `readonly-connector` | the mailbox itself, as a store: every message and the account's mail settings |
| [The Google Workspace MCP servers (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Chat)](../../../../examples/index.md) | `default` | the Google account's Drive and mailbox - every file owned by or shared to the user; not your machine |
| [A self-hosted n8n instance, reached with an owner-scoped API key](../../../../examples/index.md) | `owner-api-key` | the instance itself: its accounts, its credential store, its execution records |
| [ChatGPT (in the browser, no connectors)](../../../../examples/index.md) | `default` | the vendor's environment; not your machine |

**That is the ABP's own argument in one column.** The same word, the same grammar, and a materially different exposure depending on where the agent runs. It is why an ABP is about the deployment rather than the product.

## How this node connects

| Edge | Reads as | To |
|---|---|---|
| `reachable_from` | `host` is the reach of these 8 primitives | 8 capabilities |
| `reaches` | the inverse, walked the other way, with different fan out | one capability at a time |
