# The transfer API, one encrypted handover, one link

The other half of the API on this host. A **vault** is a versioned encrypted tree you clone, pull and push; a **transfer** is a single encrypted payload uploaded once and handed over as one link. Same server, same zero-knowledge property, different job, and until now this site documented a transfer *header* without documenting a single transfer *endpoint*.

**Provenance.** This page is derived from an integration guide written by the team that owns the SG/Send API, who executed **every request, response, status code and byte layout in it against the production user API on 9 September 2026**. That run is theirs, not ours. We have not re-executed it here, and the date is the one to check it against. Their guide is released under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Transfer or vault?

Pick this first; it decides everything after it.

|  | Transfer | [Vault](vault-objects.md) |
|---|---|---|
| **Shape** | One payload, uploaded once | A versioned tree of files |
| **History** | None. There is no second version | Commits, branches, merges |
| **The reader gets** | The whole payload, or nothing | Any single file, without fetching the rest |
| **Lifecycle** | Expires, caps downloads, can be revoked | Lives until you delete it |
| **The credential** | A decryption key in the URL fragment | A [read key](../docs/vault/reading-a-vault-file.md), derived one-way |
| **Reach for it when** | An agent finishes a job and hands the result over **once**: a bundle, a report, a dated export | The thing is read repeatedly, browsed, updated, or rendered as an app |

The SG/API team's own guidance, for a workflow that ships one bundle per voice memo, is that the transfer API is *“the simpler and better fit”*. That is the right instinct in general: **a vault is the wrong answer for a handover that happens once.**

## Two secrets that must never be confused

This is the part that goes wrong first, and it goes wrong silently, a leaked access key does not throw.

|  | What it authorises | Where it goes |
|---|---|---|
| **The access key** `x-sgraph-access-token` | *You*, to upload | A request **header**. Never a URL, never a share link, never a log |
| **The decryption key** | *Anyone*, to read | The URL **fragment**: everything after `#`, which no browser sends to the server |

They are unrelated values. The fragment is what makes a share link both shareable and private: the key reaches the recipient's client and never the origin serving the page. The API also accepts `?access_token=` as a query fallback and it works, **do not use it**; query strings land in proxy logs, browser history and workflow execution records.

What the server can see: ciphertext size, a hashed sender IP, a creation timestamp, and the `content_type_hint` you supply. What it cannot see: the filename, the contents, or the key.

## The payload format, two layers, in this order

The filename must not reach the server, so it is wrapped *inside* the plaintext before encryption. Getting the order wrong produces a corrupt download with no name.

**Inner, the SGMETA envelope:**

```
"SGMETA\0"          7 bytes    53 47 4D 45 54 41 00
meta_len            4 bytes    uint32, big-endian
metadata JSON       meta_len   {"filename":"…"}  UTF-8
file bytes          rest       your payload
```

**Outer, AES-256-GCM over that whole buffer:**

```
IV                 12 bytes    random, fresh per upload, prepended
ciphertext + tag   rest        GCM appends its own 16-byte tag
```

- **Key:** 32 random bytes, shared as **base64url, unpadded**: 43 characters.
- **IV:** 12 random bytes, never reused with the same key.
- **Overhead:** the uploaded payload is exactly **28 bytes larger** than the plaintext (12 + 16).

Same primitive as everything else here: AES-256-GCM, done client-side, with the server holding ciphertext under a key it never had. [The security page](../security/index.md) covers why that is the whole product rather than a feature of it.

## The three calls

| Call | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **1 · create** | `POST /api/transfers/create` | Returns `transfer_id`. Body carries `file_size_bytes` (the *plaintext* length, display metadata only), `content_type_hint` (stored in the clear, keep it generic), `max_downloads`, `auto_delete`, `expires_at` |
| **2 · upload** | `POST /api/transfers/upload/{id}` | **Raw bytes**: not base64, not multipart. `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` |
| **3 · complete** | `POST /api/transfers/complete/{id}` | Nothing is downloadable until this call lands |

Only those three need the access key. `info` and `download` are **public by design**: the decryption key is the gate, which is exactly why a share link works for someone with no account.

**Two traps in the create body.** `expires_at` is in **milliseconds** since epoch, not seconds; `0` means never. And `max_downloads: 0` means *unlimited*, not zero, once a finite allowance is exhausted, downloads return **410**.

### Build the share link yourself

`complete` returns a `download_url` of `/d/{id}`. **Ignore it**: verified as a 404; it is not a live route. The link to hand out is:

```
https://send.sgraph.ai/en-gb/download/#{transfer_id}/{key_base64url}
```

Omit `/{key}` for a link-only form when the key travels through a second channel. The fragment parser splits on the **first** `/` and truncates at a `|`, so `|` is reserved, base64url never produces one, so following the format above keeps you clear.

## What a receiving agent has to do

This is the payoff, and it is two calls with no account and no browser: `GET /api/transfers/download/{id}` needs no auth, and the key from the fragment does the rest, split the IV off the first 12 bytes, AES-GCM decrypt, check the `SGMETA\0` magic, read the big-endian length, and the filename and payload fall out. For a JSON-only transport such as an MCP tool, `GET /api/transfers/download-base64/{id}` returns the same bytes wrapped in JSON.

**Downloads are counted.** An agent retrying a failed run burns the allowance. For agent-facing links prefer `max_downloads: 0` with a short `expires_at`, time-bounded rather than attempt-bounded, because a retry is not a reader.

## Expiry, caps and revocation

Revocation is opt-in **at create time and only then**: set `delete_auth_hash` to `sha256(secret)` in hex and store the secret beside the transfer id. Without it, deletion is disabled for that transfer forever. To revoke, `DELETE /api/transfers/delete/{id}` carrying the access key and `x-sgraph-transfer-delete-auth: <the secret, not the hash>`, the one header [the authentication page](authentication.md) already listed before this page existed to explain it.

**410 and 404 are both normal end states, not errors to retry:** 410 is gone-as-expected (expired or exhausted), 404 is never-existed-or-deleted.

## Size

| Path | Ceiling | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct upload** | keep the encrypted payload under **~4 MB** | The normal case |
| Multipart / presigned | Larger | Needs the S3 backend, check `GET /api/presigned/capabilities` first |

The ~4 MB figure is a working limit rather than a published one: the Lambda URL caps a request body at 6 MB and the browser client switches to presigned at 5 MB. Text bundles compress far below it; **audio does not**, and is usually the most sensitive part of a bundle as well as the largest.

## Verified behaviour

The SG/API team's run, 9 September 2026, reproduced here as they reported it:

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| Header `x-sgraph-access-token` | **200** |
| Header `x-sgraph-send-access-token` | **401**: that name does not work |
| No token, or a wrong one | **401** |
| `download` / `info` with no token | **200**: public by design |
| Round trip: wrap → encrypt → create → upload → complete → download → decrypt → unwrap | **Byte-identical** payload recovered, filename intact |
| Download #3 against `max_downloads: 2` | **410** |
| Download of an expired transfer | **410** |
| `DELETE` with wrong / correct delete-auth | **403** / **200**, then **404** |
| `GET /d/{transfer_id}` | **404**: not a route |
| Key length | 32 bytes → 43 base64url characters |
| Encrypted payload overhead | plaintext + 28 bytes |

## The rules worth holding to

1. **Never log or return the decryption key** outside the share link. It is not an identifier, anyone holding it reads the payload. In a workflow engine that means keeping it out of node output that gets persisted.
2. **Never put the access key in a URL.** Header only.
3. **Never reuse an IV.** Twelve fresh random bytes per upload.
4. **Keep the filename inside the envelope.** `content_type_hint` is in the clear; the name is not, and that is the reason the envelope exists.
5. **Always set an expiry.** A link pasted into a chat lives as long as the chat does; the transfer should not.
6. **Bundle for a reader who is an agent**: a `manifest.json` saying what each file is, and an `llms.txt`, cost nothing and are the difference between a payload that can be used and one that has to be opened by a person first.
