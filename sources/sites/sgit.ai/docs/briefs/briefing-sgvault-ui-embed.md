## What we are building, in one paragraph

sgit.ai is about to publish three demo vaults as end-to-end walkthroughs: create the vault, structure it, push it, derive the read key, publish the read key **on purpose**, and then, the part this briefing is about, **open the vault's app UI live inside a page on sgit.ai, using only that published read key**. The walkthrough page and the working embed sit next to each other, so the page does not describe the mechanism; it *is* the mechanism.

We know you already solved the hard part. The SG/Vault web app opens a vault app inside a sandboxed iframe with no origin, injects the `window.sg` bridge, enforces the deny-by-default permission model, and handles `sg-app-ready`. We do not want to re-implement any of that, one unified codebase is the point, and showing *your* host code running inside a third-party page is itself the demonstration.

## What we already have on our side

- Pages on sgit.ai are plain static HTML on GitHub Pages (also served in-vault via the SG bridge).
- We already read encrypted vaults from the browser directly: `assets/vault-docs.js` derives file ids (HMAC-SHA256 over `sg-vault-v1:file-id:…` domain strings), fetches ciphertext from `dev.send.sgraph.ai` over CORS, and decrypts with Web Crypto. The Deploy section runs on it in production.
- We know `dev.vault.sgraph.ai` serves with `access-control-allow-origin: *`.
- We can already do the trivial version: `<iframe src="https://dev.vault.sgraph.ai/en-gb/#<read-key>:<vault-id>">`. That embeds your whole app, chrome and all. It is our fallback, not our goal, we want the **app iframe host** (the inner mechanism), not the outer site.

## The questions

1. **Which modules are the app-iframe host?** The code that: creates the sandboxed/opaque-origin iframe, injects or proxies `window.sg`, speaks the postMessage protocol, waits for `sg-app-ready`, and routes `sg.vfs`/`sg.loadCss`/`sg.loadJs` calls to vault reads. File names / entry points, and how tangled they are with the rest of the site.
2. **Is there (or could there cheaply be) a single embeddable entry point?** Ideal shape for us: one script we can load from your origin (you have CORS) (something like `sg-vault-embed.js` exposing `SGVaultEmbed.mount(el, { endpoint, vault_id, read_key })`) that builds the app iframe and bridge exactly the way your site does. If it exists in some form, tell us its name; if it is a refactor, tell us its size.
3. **Read-key-only mode.** When the host is constructed from a read key rather than a vault key: which `sg.*` namespaces work, which fail, and how do they fail? (We assume all reads work and every mutation is refused, we want to state the exact behaviour on the walkthrough pages, not our assumption.)
4. **The sandbox recipe.** The exact `sandbox`/`allow` attributes and CSP you use for the app iframe, and which parts are load-bearing for security versus convenience. We will reproduce them verbatim and credit the source.
5. **Version stability.** If we load your script cross-origin, your deploys become our deploys. Is there a pinned/versioned URL, or should we vendor a copy and track releases? What is the compatibility contract on the postMessage protocol?
6. **The `_page.json` renderer.** Some demo vaults are content-authored (markdown + `_page.json`) rather than full vault apps. Is the renderer for that reachable through the same embed path, or is it a separate module?

## Empirical findings (15 Aug), we ran the experiment so you don't have to

We drove your real UI headless (ciphertext and assets mirrored; same bytes) with vault `4bshby5n` framed inside a third-party page:

1. **The UI is frameable.** No `X-Frame-Options`, no `frame-ancestors` on `dev.vault.sgraph.ai`.
2. **App Mode works inside a cross-origin iframe, chrome and all.** With a valid credential in the root hash inbox, the frame redirected to `/en-gb/app`, `app-shell` booted our demo app, and the full HUD rendered, Open Vault, AI button, `R1 W0`, the Read-only badge, the URL bar. Screenshot available on request.
3. **The read-only credential is parsed but not honoured.** `vault-loader-format.js` documents format 4, `<vault_id> <64-hex read_key>`, but the client rejects it: `[app-shell] init failed: Invalid vault key format. Expected {passphrase}:{vault_id} or …` (the message goes on to offer a legacy credential form). The CLI's `{64-hex}:{vault_id}` shorthand fares worse: the 64-hex is treated as a passphrase, PBKDF2'd, and derives the wrong file ids ("Vault not found: HEAD ref missing", it looked for `ref-pid-muw-abfd8ea0f1a2`; the read-key-derived ref is `ref-pid-muw-11ea50e81f4d`).
4. **`/en-gb/vault` (the browser surface with the FILES / SGIT / SETTINGS rail) stalled at "Loading Vault UI, Initialising…" in our harness.** Possibly an artifact of our mirror (a dynamic call we broke) rather than your code, unverified, not "broken". `vault-nav` switches views via a `vault-nav-switch` event, and we found no URL that selects a view.

## The two asks these findings sharpen

**Ask 1, honour format 4 end to end.** This is now the single blocker: the moment `SGVault` accepts `<vault_id> <64-hex read_key>`, sgit.ai can embed your *actual UI* on the public demo pages with only the published read key, `<iframe src="https://dev.vault.sgraph.ai/#<vault_id>%20<read_key>">`, and everything else already works (finding 2). Our minimal host becomes the fallback rather than the demo.

**Ask 2, a deep-link that selects a view.** The routing supports `#token|path` and `|app:path`; a `|view:sgit` (and `|view:files`, `|view:settings`) segment would let a page embed the SGit view in isolation, the commit/ref/tree inspector is exactly what a "look inside the encrypted store" demo wants to show, and today it is only reachable by a click inside the frame.

## The concrete ask

Whichever is cheapest for you, in order of our preference:

1. **A pointer** ("the host is these N files, here is how they compose, load them like this") and we do the integration and write it up.
2. **A minimal `sg-vault-embed.js`** published at a stable URL on your origin, if the host is close to embeddable already.
3. **A short written answer** to questions 3–4 only, and we ship the fallback iframe embed first while the reuse path is worked out.

We will document whatever we build as a public how-to on sgit.ai (with a case study of the integration), so this work pays twice: the demos ship, and "embed a vault app in any page" becomes a documented capability of the platform with your code at the centre of it.

## Constraints we are holding on our side

- **The vault keys of the demo vaults never appear anywhere**: not in pages, repos, or logs. Only read keys are published, and publishing them is deliberate and stated on the page. Our build refuses to push if a vault passphrase appears in any tracked file.
- We treat your permission model as the source of truth: nothing in our embed may widen what a read key can do.

*Reply by whatever channel is easiest, a markdown answer pushed to any vault or repo we can read is perfect. This briefing is also linked from https://sgit.ai/briefs/ alongside the other cross-team briefs.*

## Addendum, 16 August: the main ask landed and is verified; the remaining ask, sharpened

Your read-key open shipped and we verified it from sgit.ai the same day: all three credential forms
parse in the deployed loader, App Mode boots our demo vault from the published read key alone inside
a cross-origin iframe, and the vault browser opens read-only with the `R1 W0` badge showing. We also
adopted your embed protocol immediately, the demo page now opens both surfaces via
`?embed=1&parent=` + the `vault-open` handshake, and it is a strictly better mechanism than the
fragment flow we first tested: no key in any URL, no key in the frame's storage, structured
`vault-ready` / `vault-error` back to the host. Thank you, this closed the gap exactly as briefed.

**The one remaining ask, now precise because your protocol makes it precise.** `vault-open` carries
`{key, mode, deepLink}` and `deepLink` is a file path. There is no way for the embedding page to
select a *view*: SGIT and SETTINGS are in-page events (`vault-nav-switch` → `_switchView(viewId)`).
The ask is one optional field:

```
{ sg: 'vault-open', key, mode: 'vault', view: 'files' | 'sgit' | 'settings' }
```

applied in `vault-shell`'s embed `onOpen` after mount, effectively
`parsed.view && this._switchView(parsed.view)` once `vault-browse-mounted` has fired, plus the one
line in `EmbedProtocol.parseOpenMessage` to pass it through. That single field lets a page frame the
SGIT inspector directly, the commit/ref/tree view is the best possible "look inside the encrypted
store" demonstration, and today it is one un-clickable rail click away from being embeddable on its
own. A `|view:` form of the URL deep-link would extend the same to shareable links, but the protocol
field alone unblocks us.
