# The board

The open work on this site, as a kanban. Each card is a markdown file in [**a vault of its own**](../demos/vaults/board/index.md) with a `status` line; the columns are those lines, rendered. **Needs** are items only the author can supply and are kept visible rather than discovered late; everything else is work an agent can pick up from its [starting prompt](prompts.md).

**The vault is the truth; this page is a snapshot.** The board lives in vault `pdulwi6i` and is updated by `sgit push` with no site release. What you see below is the state at site v0.6.8, rendered from a clone the release pulled first. For the live board, open the vault, the read key is the whole credential, because every card is public:
`f41d03b0de550479b3c4359709130386df48f34b2cd75e5ed83de28e9776b479:pdulwi6i`

[Open the live board in a new tab ↗](https://dev.vault.sgraph.ai/#f41d03b0de550479b3c4359709130386df48f34b2cd75e5ed83de28e9776b479%3Apdulwi6i)Five columns from the same files, as the vault holds them right now.

**18 items**: 15 open, 6 of them waiting on the author. Each card is a file under `admin/content/team/issues/`; moving a card is editing its `status` line.

### Needs, only the author can supply 6

N1, **The ask: round size, instrument, and what it buys**, [Ambassador](roles/ambassador.md) · high · 2026-09-07

The [investors page](../investors/index.md) has the architecture, the traction and the business model, and a dashed box where the ask goes. Round size, instrument and the use-of-funds split are the author's to state; nothing is invented in the meantime. Unblocks: a page that can be handed to an angel without a caveat.

N2, **The deck, or permission to build one from the page**, [Ambassador](roles/ambassador.md) · high · 2026-09-07

Your other companies publish the pitch in the open (investor.myfeeds.ai). Either the sgit deck exists and should be linked, or the investors page is the source and a deck can be built from it — a vault with a presenter app, like the [VoiceDebrief pitch](../demos/vaults/voicedebrief-pitch/index.md). Unblocks: something to show in the room next week.

N3, **A vault where two agents and a human merge are visible in the history**, [Publisher](roles/publisher.md) · high · 2026-09-07

The homepage's strongest multi-agent claim — a branch per agent, a human reviews the merge — has no published vault behind it. If one exists, its read key is enough; if not, the next multi-agent build should be run so its history shows it. Unblocks: closing the gap the [after article](../articles/proof-moved-up.md) names; it goes in the hero.

N4, **The games vault: one manifest line so the telemetry actually sends**, [Publisher](roles/publisher.md) · medium · 2026-09-07

The other agent's fix is `{"permissions": {"append": {"write": true}}}` and a switch to `sg.append.write` — not `network: true`. When it lands, the page's status note comes off and the two 'nothing sent' footers should be gone. Unblocks: the [games vault page](../demos/vaults/agent-permission-games/index.md) describing behaviour the vault performs.

N5, **Answers to the seven append-lane questions**, [Cartographer](roles/cartographer.md) · medium · 2026-09-07

Sent to the SG/API team on 7 September (in the CLI repo under `team/humans/dinis_cruz/claude-code-web/09/07/`). The two that matter most: which hosts serve `/api/vault/append/*`, and whether the enum-key derivation is stable enough to publish as a spec. Unblocks: the API page stating facts where it currently says unresolved.

N6, **Republish the two held vaults clean, or retire them**, [Auditor](roles/auditor.md) · low · 2026-09-07

`bite-coil` (a live provider key in `key.json`, since rotated) and `6kdhnpfx` are held on audit findings. Both are republishable via a fresh vault with the offending file removed. A decision either way closes them. Unblocks: the vaults count telling the whole story.

### Backlog 7

T1, **An About page about sgit, linking to the fuller record**, [Ambassador](roles/ambassador.md) · high · 2026-09-07

Agreed direction: who builds it (one human and the roles on this page), why, the commercial line (sgraph.ai sells the hosted service; the code stays Apache-2.0), and two sections borrowed from open-source.sgit.ai/about — *Interests declared* and *Reach me, or correct me* — with a `!site` card out to the fuller record rather than a copy of it.

T2, **Re-verify the 21 published read keys with the marker that actually discriminates**, [Auditor](roles/auditor.md) · high · 2026-09-07

The earlier 24-key sweep used the presence of `.sg_vault/` as success, which an all-zeros key also produces. Three vaults were verified properly by decrypting content; the other 21 were not. Re-run with `clone_mode.json` as the marker and a negative control.

T11, **The chat pane inside a vault: route through sg.llm instead of a pasted key**, [Designer](roles/designer.md) · medium · 2026-09-07

The pane (`assets/site-chat.js`) has three tiers and the third is not wired: when a page renders inside a vault, `sg.llm.chat` would let the host hold the key below the permission floor. Blocked on one fact — whether the bridge's chat contract accepts OpenAI-style `tools` and returns `tool_calls`. Ask llms.sgit.ai's owners; until then the pane falls back to the key-in-page tier with the warning it already carries.

T3, **Investors page: print stylesheet and a one-page PDF export**, [Designer](roles/designer.md) · medium · 2026-09-07

The page should print to one or two clean pages for the event. The site already has `@media print` rules; extend them for the investor bands and check the output.

T12, **Transcribe the seven Licence to Operate shorts**, [Journalist](roles/journalist.md) · medium · 2026-09-09

The [seven shorts](../demos/vaults/licence-to-operate/videos/index.md) are indexed with the author's own descriptions, but **not transcribed** — YouTube returns no caption track for any of them, on any of the four `timedtext` endpoints. So the words spoken are absent from the site, from `llms-full.txt` and from the chat pane's `read_page` tool, which is exactly the failure the [Risk Graph Explorer walkthroughs](../demos/vaults/risk-graph-explorer/videos/index.md) page was built to avoid. Needs the author's transcripts from YouTube Studio (auto-transcript works even when the public track is absent), then the same treatment as the walkthroughs: timestamped moments that deep-link into the video, and captured frames.

T6, **Flip skills.sgit.ai from not-published to live when Pages serves it**, [Cartographer](roles/cartographer.md) · low · 2026-09-07

DNS and a repository exist; the site 404s from GitHub Pages. Listed in the network directory as *not published yet* rather than omitted. Re-check weekly.

T7, **Upstream: graphs.sgit.ai footer links to sentinel.sgit.ai, which does not resolve**, [Cartographer](roles/cartographer.md) · low · 2026-09-07

The site is at `sg-sentinel.sgit.ai`; the `sg-` prefix is load-bearing. Noted on our graphs page since 21 August; the brief to their team is the remaining step.

### Review 2

T4, **The agentic section: roles, starting prompts, the board**, [Sherpa](roles/sherpa.md) · high · 2026-09-07

Nine roles as files under `admin/content/team/roles/`, a page each; the starting prompts for the regular tasks; this board, as files under `admin/content/team/issues/`. In review: does each prompt start a fresh agent correctly with nothing but the page?

T5, **The investors section, on the open-investor-materials model**, [Ambassador](roles/ambassador.md) · high · 2026-09-07

Same structure as investor.myfeeds.ai — hook, how it works, architecture, market, traction, business model, the ask, use of funds — with the traction numbers computed from the site and the ask left visibly open (N1). In review: nothing on it may be a number the author has not supplied.

### Done 3

T8, **Rebuild the homepage: proof before mechanism**, [Ambassador](roles/ambassador.md) · high · 2026-09-07

Shipped as v0.2.60, with the diagnosis in v0.2.59 and two corrections in v0.2.61. [Before](../articles/proof-behind-the-claim.md) and [after](../articles/proof-moved-up.md).

T9, **The vaults table: sortable, categorised, no keys, newest first**, [Designer](roles/designer.md) · medium · 2026-09-06

Shipped as v0.2.57 and v0.2.58: generated from `vaults.json`, `#` as a permanent publication ordinal, published dates from git.

T10, **A card for pointing at the sibling sites (!site)**, [Cartographer](roles/cartographer.md) · medium · 2026-09-07

Shipped in v0.2.59. One line in markdown; the card pulls the target site's own category and thesis from `sites/*.md`.

**Moving a card** is editing one line in the vault and pushing; the site picks it up at its next release. **Adding one** is adding one file with `id`, `title`, `kind` (need | task), `status`, `role`, `priority`, `opened` and a body that says what it unblocks, then `python3 tools/reindex.py` so the app can read it outside a host. A card that names a Need is closed only by the author's answer. Corrections to published claims are not cards; they are [version-log entries](../admin/versions.md), so the record of the mistake is never tidied away.
