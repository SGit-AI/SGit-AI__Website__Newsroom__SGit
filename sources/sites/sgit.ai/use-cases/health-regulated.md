# Data that changes what is permissible

When the host provably cannot read the content, the conversation stops being about the provider's access controls, because there is nothing for them to control access to.

**Read this first.** sgit holds no compliance certification of any kind, no HIPAA attestation, no ISO 27001, no SOC 2, no GDPR adequacy finding. Nothing on this page is legal or regulatory advice, and client-side encryption does not by itself make a processing activity lawful. What follows is a description of a technical property and what it does and does not change. Your compliance function decides the rest.

## The problem

Regulated data drags its rules with it. The moment a document is stored somewhere a third party can read, that third party is in scope: they become a processor, they need an agreement, their jurisdiction matters, their breach becomes your notification, and their sub-processors become your problem too. Most of the effort in these projects is not securing the data. It is the paperwork proving who could have seen it.

And the work itself still needs versions and collaboration, which is why it so often ends up in a general-purpose tool with a data-processing addendum stapled on.

## What the property actually changes

Content is encrypted before it leaves the client; the store holds ciphertext under opaque ids and never receives a key. That moves specific arguments, and it is worth being exact about which:

| Question | What changes |
|---|---|
| Can the host read the content? | No, not with a warrant, a rogue administrator, or a breach. This is the strong claim, and it is structural rather than procedural. |
| What does the host still learn? | The vault id, the size of each object, and request timing. Sizes and timing are a real if narrow side channel, see the [security page](../security/index.md). |
| Does this remove the processor relationship? | **Not automatically.** Storing ciphertext may still be processing, depending on the regime and on who holds keys. Ask your counsel; do not take a vendor's word for it, including ours. |
| Does it help with access logging and minimisation? | Partly: a vault is a natural boundary, and read access is a key rather than an account, which makes "who could read this" a shorter list. |
| Does it help with retention and deletion? | Partly, and awkwardly: history keeps old ciphertext until pruned, so "delete" needs thought. See [limitations](../docs/limitations.md). |

## The recipe

**Scope one vault to one purpose.** The vault is the access boundary, so make it match the lawful basis for the data in it, not the team, not the project folder.

```
$ sgit create study-1234-analysis
$ sgit commit -m "structure" && sgit push
```

**Key management is the whole control.** There is no reset and no recovery: the key is the access control, so it has to be managed like one, in a password manager or an HSM-backed store, with a named owner and a documented rotation path.

```
$ sgit vault backup --include-key     # archive and key stored separately
$ sgit vault rekey                          # rotation — see the exposed-key runbook
```

**Self-host if the storage layer is itself in scope.** The [deployment guidance](../deploy/index.md) covers Docker, AWS, GCP and a static host, and is itself served from an encrypted vault, which is a small demonstration of the property.

## A worked example you can open right now

The abstract version of this page is "the host cannot read it". The concrete version is a vault you can open in your browser in the next ten seconds: [**the Supplement Stack vault**](../demos/vaults/supplement-stack/index.md), a real, patient-held health record, published with a read key.

It is worth reading because it answers the questions this page raises in the specific rather than the general:

| The question | How that vault answers it |
|---|---|
| Who holds the data? | The patient. The vault is theirs; the write key never leaves them |
| How is it shared with a clinician? | By handing over a **read key**: no account on anyone's platform, no PDF emailed into permanent circulation. The reader sees everything and can change nothing |
| What stops the app doing more than it should? | `app.json` grants write over `adherence/` and nothing else. The record-keeping app cannot alter the record it reports on, least authority, declared in the vault |
| Where does AI fit without being dangerous? | A model does the fuzzy work (reading amounts off a label photograph, each value traceable back to its image); **code** does the exact work (summing them). Every fuzzy step is checkable against its source |
| Does it give medical advice? | No, and that is designed in. It computes the total nobody else computes and produces a *briefing for somebody qualified*, with the open questions listed. It never concludes |
| Whose reference values? | UK RNIs and EFSA upper limits, named and dated, explicitly not US Daily Values, because comparing a UK intake against US references without saying so is a quiet error |

It is a demonstration rather than a deployed clinical system, and it makes no compliance claim of any kind, but every mechanism above is running, readable, and open to inspection with the key on its page.

## Evidence status

PATTERN, and the most caveated page here

No published healthcare or regulated-industry deployment, no certification, and no audit of the implementation by a third party. What exists is: standard primitives (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2-SHA256 at 600k, HKDF) with no custom cryptography, ~4,000 tests, byte-for-byte test vectors against the browser's Web Crypto, two independent implementations of the same wire format, and a [published threat model](../security/index.md) that names its own side channels.

That is evidence of engineering care. It is not evidence of compliance, and we are not going to blur the two.

## Brief for an agent

Paste this into an agent that has the [sgit skill](../skills/index.md) installed, or point it at the markdown directly.

```
# everything on this site is readable as markdown — no HTML parsing needed
$ curl -s https://sgit.ai/use-cases/health-regulated.md
$ curl -s https://sgit.ai/llms.txt          # the index of everything
```

> Read https://sgit.ai/use-cases/health-regulated.md and https://sgit.ai/docs/agents.md. Then set up a scoped vault for regulated data for this project: create the vault, structure the folders as described, commit and push, and report the vault key back to me once, I will store it. Do not write the key to any file in the repository. Do not claim any compliance property in what you write; describe only the technical behaviour.

That last sentence matters. We have a [write-up of the day we got it wrong](../case-studies/exposed-vault-key.md).
