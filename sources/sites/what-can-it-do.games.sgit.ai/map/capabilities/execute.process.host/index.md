# Run programs as the account

`execute.process.host` — **execute** × **process** at **host** reach (the machine, container or account it runs as). Family: process. Effect: **recoverable from a backup, a history or a revert, at a cost**.

## What narrows it

**The setting:** keep the confirmation prompt on for commands, and run in a container: execution survives inside it and stops being execution on your machine

**What it costs:** a click per command · an afternoon for the container

**Tier after:** setting (prompt) · boundary (container)

## Questions that ask about it

- *Have you ever clicked something that said 'always allow', or turned its confirmations off?* — eliciting, reliability 0.6
