## What narrows it

**The setting:** run the agent in a container with only the project mounted, or under a separate user account

**What it costs:** an afternoon, then ongoing friction (container) · days, and it fights you (account)

**Tier after:** boundary

## Questions that ask about it

- *Can it read files on your machine that are not the project?* — eliciting, reliability 0.35
