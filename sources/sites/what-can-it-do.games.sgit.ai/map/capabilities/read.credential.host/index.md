## What narrows it

**The setting:** keep credentials out of the account the agent runs as: a credential helper, a separate account, or a container without your home mounted

**What it costs:** an afternoon, and re-authenticating where the agent needs a credential of its own

**Tier after:** boundary

## Questions that ask about it

- *Are your cloud, SSH or registry credentials in the home directory of the account it runs as?* — eliciting, reliability 0.3
