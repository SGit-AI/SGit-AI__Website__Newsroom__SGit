# Delete files anywhere the account can reach

`delete.file.host` — **delete** × **file** at **host** reach (the machine, container or account it runs as). Family: filesystem. Effect: **cannot be undone**.

## Granted by 4 of 9

| Profile | Control on the path | Evidence | Via |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code — web container](../../../map/grants/anthropic/claude-code-remote/ccr-container/index.md) | ● none | observed | shell (Bash) |
| [Claude Code — local · confirm off](../../../map/grants/anthropic/claude-code/local-confirmations-off/index.md) | ● none | derived | shell (Bash), files (Read, Edit, Write) |
| [Claude Code — local · confirm on](../../../map/grants/anthropic/claude-code/local-default/index.md) | ● none | derived | shell (Bash), files (Read, Edit, Write) |
| [GitHub Actions — hosted runner](../../../map/grants/github/actions-runner/ci/index.md) | ● none | observed | the job's shell |

## What narrows it

**The setting:** the same container or account; and a backup that the agent cannot reach, because delete at host reach is irreversible

**What it costs:** as above, plus a backup outside the grant

**Tier after:** boundary
