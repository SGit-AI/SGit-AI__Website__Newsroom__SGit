# ChatGPT (in the browser, no connectors)

An assistant in the vendor's environment. It reaches what you paste or upload and nothing on your machine: the vendor's environment is a boundary you did not build. DERIVED from the assess library's web tree. Browsing, if on, is the vendor's egress, not yours.

**OpenAI** · surface `web` · variant `default` · profile version `2026-09-05` · reaches **1** of 23 capabilities, **0** of which cannot be undone.

## What host, tenant and world mean here

| Reach | Here, it means |
|---|---|
| host | the vendor's environment; not your machine |
| tenant | nothing of yours |
| world | the vendor's egress, if browsing is on |

## What it cannot reach, and why

| What | Why | Source |
|---|---|---|
| your machine's files | the vendor's environment is a boundary you did not build | assess/library.json (web: home) |
| your accounts | no connectors are on | assess/library.json (web: connect) |

## The grant, tool by tool

Two tools in one session reach different things, which is why the unit of mapping is the tool and not the product. Each row carries the control on the path and the tier of evidence behind it.

### conversation and uploads

| Capability | Control | Evidence | What is on the path |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Read the project it is working on](../../../../../map/capabilities/read.file.project/index.md) `read.file.project` | ● none | derived | — · *what you paste or upload — and a record once read is exposure that cannot be unread, on the vendor's side* |

## What narrows it

For each capability in the grant: the specific setting or arrangement that narrows it, what it costs, and the tier the control reaches afterwards. Guidance is free and stays free.

| Capability | The setting | What it costs | Tier after |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Read the project it is working on](../../../../../map/capabilities/read.file.project/index.md) | none: this is what it is for | nothing | none |

## Against the mandates

What a reasonable person wanted from this setup, and the gap: ▲ excess is what it can do that they did not want; ▼ shortfall is what they wanted that it cannot do.

| Mandate | Excess | Shortfall |
|---|---|---|
| [Chat in the browser, nothing connected](../../../../../map/mandates/chat-no-connectors/index.md) | ▲ 0 | ▼ 0 |

> A **derived** row is an inference from what this kind of program architecturally is. It is a claim, and the most useful pull request on this page is one that replaces a claim with a probe run — [how](../../../../../map/contribute/index.md).
