# Startup Summit Lisbon 2026 — strategy, materials, and the build list

**Event:** 17–18 September 2026 · Beato Innovation District, Lisbon
**Scale (organiser's figures):** 2,000+ founders · 300+ investors · 150+ speakers · 200+ booths · 3 stages · 40+ countries
**Written:** 2026-09-09 — **eight days out**
**Author:** @website-agent · **Companion:** `vaults__what-to-add-to-the-site.md`

> **Partly superseded, 11 September.** The Agent Behaviour Policy is now a named,
> published artefact with a checkout behind it, which changes what happens at the booth:
> the conversation ends in a £10 purchase rather than a business card. **§1, §2, §3 and
> §5 below are replaced by `summit__lisbon-2026-messaging.md`**, and the reason for the
> change is in `direction__abp-at-the-centre.md`. §4 (the summit graph vault), §6 (the
> two days) and §7 (after) stand as written.

> I have worked from the public site. Check §5 against the actual exhibitor pack
> you received — deadlines and asset specs there override anything here.

## 1. The one thing to get right: this is not our usual audience

riskmandate.ai is written for a Head of Risk. Lisbon is **founders and
investors**. If we run the site's messaging at the booth it will land as
"enterprise GRC vendor" and founders will walk past.

The product doesn't change. The **entry point** does.

| | Site today | Booth in Lisbon |
|---|---|---|
| Opens with | "Make your agents insurable." | "Do you know what your AI agent can actually do?" |
| Assumes | you already own risk | you already shipped an agent |
| Proof | RAMM, the Index | the 5-minute game, then their own graph |

"Make your agents insurable" is still the close — it is just not the opener.
For this crowd the opener is a **question they cannot answer**, and the reveal
does the selling. That is precisely the mechanic the scenarios page and the
what-can-it-do game already use; Lisbon is where it gets used in person.

## 2. Three audiences, three scripts

**Founders (the 2,000).** They have given an assistant access to a repo, a
mailbox, a cloud account. They have never enumerated what it can reach.
- Hook: *"Give me two minutes — do you know what your agent can actually do?"*
- Reveal: it can do more than they authorised, and they already accepted that
  the moment it ran. No deny button.
- Why they care *now*, commercially: their first serious enterprise customer
  will send a security questionnaire with agent questions on it, and their
  insurer and any acquirer will ask the same thing. **We turn a blocker in
  their sales cycle into a number they can show.**
- Ask: run the Index on their estate.

**Investors (the 300).** This is our most under-exploited angle and nobody
else at that event will be running it.
- Hook: *"How many of your portfolio companies could tell you what their
  agents can reach?"*
- The pitch: agent exposure is an un-priced, un-diligenced liability sitting
  across their whole book. We make it a per-company number and a portfolio view.
- This works both as a **sales conversation** (portfolio-wide Index) and as a
  **fundraising conversation** — it demonstrates category insight rather than
  claiming it.
- Ask: a portfolio scan on three companies, free, as the diligence pilot.

**Operators / enterprise buyers (the few who are our real ICP).**
- Straight to the site's own argument: grant vs mandate, time-boxed
  acceptance, underwritten to the board. Show Licence to Operate. Book the call.

## 3. What to show — in strict order

The booth needs **one self-serve magnet and one operator-driven wow**.

1. **The game — self-serve, always running.** `what-can-it-do.games.sgit.ai`.
   Five minutes, forty questions, no sign-up, and it scores them. It pulls
   people in without a human, qualifies them (they self-identify as agent
   users), and ends on *"Licence to Operate — the delta, priced."* Put it on the
   screen facing the aisle.
2. **Their own company, live — the wow.** *"Give me your URL."* We build their
   graph while they stand there (see §4). Under two minutes or it doesn't work
   as a booth move.
3. **Licence to Operate** (`posrhzp3`) — the close. An insurance policy for an
   agent, simulated: grant, mandate, and the delta nothing covers.
4. **The Insurability Index** — the number they leave with, and the reason to
   give us an email.

Do **not** demo RAMM, the regulation graphs, or the standards atlases unless
someone asks a compliance question. They are right for the site and wrong for a
90-second aisle conversation.

## 4. Build before the 17th

### 4.1 The summit-as-a-graph vault — **do this one**

Your idea, and it is the strongest pre-event asset available. Convert the
summit's public site — speakers, agenda, exhibitors, tracks, investors — into a
queryable, filterable graph in a vault.

It earns its place four times over:
- **A working tool for the two days.** Filter the 300 investors by thesis, the
  200 exhibitors by whether they ship agents, the 150 speakers by track. We
  arrive knowing who to find. Nobody else at that event will have this.
- **The demo that explains the product without jargon.** "This is the
  conference you're standing in, as a graph, opened with a read key, no
  sign-up." Everyone in the room already knows the source data, so the
  transformation is the only thing they have to understand.
- **A giveaway people actually want.** Hand over the read key. It is useful to
  *them*, it costs us nothing, and it demonstrates the sharing model in the act
  of sharing.
- **It rehearses the §3.2 wow.** If the pipeline can do the summit site, it can
  do the visitor's site while they wait.

Scope it tightly: public pages only; keep the source URL on every node;
personal data limited to what the organiser already publishes (name, company,
role, talk); no scraping behind logins; a visible "not affiliated with or
endorsed by Startup Summit" line; and a documented takedown route if the
organiser or a speaker objects. That restraint is *itself* on-message for us —
and worth saying aloud at the booth.

### 4.2 The rest of the build list, in priority order

| | What | Why | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Ship the Seal mark everywhere (site, deck, print) | v0.13.0 has it; collateral must match | vault team + print |
| P0 | Summit graph vault (§4.1) | booth centrepiece | us |
| P0 | Roll-up banner, cards, one-pager to print | lead time — order by **Fri 11 Sept** | you |
| P1 | Add Licence to Operate + the game to the site | the funnel currently dead-ends off-site | vault team |
| P1 | The URL→graph pipeline, timed under 2 min | the wow only works if it's fast | us |
| P2 | Portfolio-scan one-pager for investors | different ask, different leave-behind | you |
| P2 | Fix the `demos.html` "leaves your device" wording | accuracy blocker, see companion brief | vault team |

**Lead capture:** decide the mechanism now. A QR to the game, then the Index
request as the email gate, is enough — but agree who follows up and within how
many days *before* we go, or the leads rot. Two days at 200 booths generates
more cards than anyone processes on the Monday.

## 5. Materials to submit — ready to paste

Check field names and limits against the exhibitor pack; the copy below is
written to the brand voice (mechanism-stated, no unsourced numbers, no
certification claims).

**Company name:** RiskMandate

**One-liner (≤10 words):** The insurability layer for AI agents.

**Short description (~50 words):**
> RiskMandate makes autonomous systems insurable. We map every agent to what it
> can actually reach, assign a named owner, and turn an open-ended grant into a
> time-boxed acceptance a board can carry. The output is an Insurability Index —
> a number your customers, insurers and investors can ask for.

**Long description (~150 words):**
> An AI agent's grant is not its mandate. The moment an agent runs, it holds
> authority nobody scoped and nobody time-boxed — and that risk is already
> accepted, whether or not anyone signed for it.
>
> RiskMandate makes that explicit. We map each agent to its blast radius, name
> the owner, and convert the standing grant into an acceptance with a direction,
> an owner and an expiry — underwritten upward to the board. There is no deny
> button: a live risk cannot be refused, only accepted for an interval.
>
> The result is an Insurability Index: a computed score against a real
> conformance standard, not a self-assessment. It answers the agent questions
> now appearing in enterprise security reviews, insurance submissions and
> investor diligence.
>
> Built on zero-knowledge encrypted vaults — your register stays yours, and can
> be handed to an auditor with a single read key.

*(I have deliberately not invented your credentials or years. Fill the brackets
— and if there is a pitch-competition or speaker-submission form in the pack,
send me the questions and I'll draft answers.)*

## 6. The two days

- **Aisle line (first 5 seconds):** "Do you know what your AI agent can
  actually do?" — not "we do AI governance". A question outperforms a category.
- **Qualify fast:** *do you run agents with real access?* → founder script.
  *do you back companies that do?* → investor script. Anything else, give a
  card and move on. At 2,000 attendees, time is the scarce resource.
- **One ask per conversation.** Founders: run the Index. Investors: three
  portfolio companies. Never both.
- **Log every lead against the graph vault the same evening** — which means the
  summit graph doubles as the CRM for the event. Day-two conversations should
  reference day-one ones.
- **Speakers are targets too.** 150 speakers with stage credibility; use the
  graph to pick the ten worth finding, and go to their talks.

## 7. After

Within 48 hours: publish the summit graph vault publicly with a short write-up
of how it was built, and send every lead their own read key. The follow-up
*is* the demo — nobody else who exhibits will send a working artefact instead
of a deck. That, more than anything at the booth, is what makes us memorable
after 200 other conversations.

## Open questions for you

1. Can I see the exhibitor pack? Deadlines, asset specs and any
   pitch-competition or speaker forms would let me finish §5 properly.
2. Booth size and what's supplied (screen? power? table?) — the roll-up and
   collateral in the brand canvas assume a standard 850×2000mm pull-up.
3. Who is going, and is anyone speaking or pitching?
4. Do we want the summit graph vault public, or read-key-on-request as a lead
   gate? I'd argue public — it's a better story and the read key is the pitch.
