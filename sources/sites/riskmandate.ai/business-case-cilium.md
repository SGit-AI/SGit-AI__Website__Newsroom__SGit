# RiskMandate — the business case for Cilium network policy

Cilium network policy (CNCF), by the risk it changes: the register for a stated agent deployment without it and with it, computed from a public model, from the operator to the board.

# Cilium network policy, by the risk it changes

Network policy for Kubernetes workloads. An egress rule puts the endpoint into default-deny for outbound traffic, and a DNS-name rule allows named destinations only. Written as an answer, the agent's workload reaches the destinations on the list and nothing else.

**Open source:** Apache-2.0 · CNCF · [get involved](https://cilium.io/get-involved)

**The deployment:** The model's typical deployment, with the answers this project addresses stated as they are without it: can reach the general internet.

**The model:** the RiskGraph Explorer's 49 facts, 49 risks and 10 roles, copied into this site with its provenance; the register below is computed, not written. [How](business-cases.html#method).

## In its own words, and nothing more.

- Egress default-deny once a rule applies, with allow-lists by DNS name. “If any rule selects an Endpoint and the rule has an egress section, the endpoint goes into default-deny mode for egress.” · [docs.cilium.io](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/intro/), read 24 September 2026

## Same deployment, different answers.

The model asks sixteen questions about an agent deployment. A product’s effect is written as the answers it changes, and each change says what kind of change it is: a statement of what is true, an expectation the agent is asked to meet, a setting, or a boundary enforced by something the agent’s grant does not include.

## 2 retired, 23 unchanged.

Computed from the model for the deployment above: every risk that holds without it, and every risk that holds with it.

Retired

## Who carries less, and who carries the same.

Each risk is assigned to the roles it belongs to, and each role reports to another until the board. The count beside each role is the entries it holds without the product and with it.

### Operators

### Owners

### Executives

### The board

At the board: the corporate register

Corporate risks have no facts of their own. They hold while any risk that leads into them holds, so a single product rarely retires one. What it changes is how many reasons the board is being given.

## Every product is also a new thing in the estate.

By default, _all egress and ingress traffic is allowed for all endpoints_, so nothing changes until a policy is written. Rules by DNS name depend on the Cilium agent pod being available.

## What adopting it takes, before any of this is true.

An open-source project costs nothing to download and something to adopt. Every change above depends on the work below, and most of it is customisation to your own deployment.

- Write the egress policy for the agent's workload, destination by destination.
- Keep the policy out of the agent's own reach in the cluster.
- Decide what happens when a new destination is needed, and who approves it.

## The limits of the case, stated by the case.

- That it was tested. Nothing was installed or run; every change rests on the documentation quoted beside it.
- That the register is complete. It is one model, for one stated deployment. A different deployment changes the answers, and so the case.

**Next.** Published, and sent to the project's maintainers at the same time. If a change is wrong, or another answer should move, the case changes with the date they said so.

## Make the case in the register’s own terms.

If you build a security product for agents, the case for it can be written the same way: what it does in your own words, the answers it changes, and the register before and after. If a case here is wrong about you, tell us and it changes with a date.
